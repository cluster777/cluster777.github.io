They complain about everything, about my unpleasant voice, that I talk too much, or that I am unpleasing to the eye. They are so annoying! In comparison, it\'s much better to work for the Guild and as an undercover intel agent, but can the bosses at the Guild stop making me deliver such large parcels? It gets in the way of letter deliveries! Also, can they stop asking me to go to Illumina for undercover intel work? I don\'t like to go there, and Yoshi is also about to become featherless from frustration because of how mindless those people at Illumina are.What?

My beak and my throat also want to make noises!I couldn\'t stop at all one day, and the neighbors came over angrily, trying to drive us away. My grandpa had no choice but to get the Courier Union to deliver me away. My parents abandoned me because I looked strange, and only my grandpa was willing to raise something as weird as me. I was quite young and misunderstood that grandpa didn\'t want me as well anymore. I wanted to cry and caw at the same time and almost choked myself to death doing that.
