No matter how friendly he appears, always assume there\'s something to the contrary under the facade.

Sorry for any trouble they caused, but it\'s actually your honor.Umbraton is different from any other place. At least that\'s what I think. It accepts anyone who\'s willing to accept it, as long as they\'re not beyond hope. Unlike Lumopolis, Umbraton doesn\'t impose belief and order on you, but every dweller has their own reason to live. Just look into their eyes when they fight, and the sweat along with the spilled blood. You\'ll know I speak the truth.As for you, you have a mission too. The one reason you live for, that you will do whatever necessary to personally see it to fruition... What can it be? I don\'t care what it is exactly, though. I just wonder if you can do it and whether you will.

Before becoming what it is now, it was a filthy, degenerate, desperate hellhole. People wasted away, frantically pursuing fleeting moments of happiness, even if that meant they wouldn\'t live to see the sunrise next day. But that\'s not their fault. The blame lied in those who exploited them, those who didn\'t belong to Umbraton, yet poisoned the town, sustaining themselves on the blood and tears of Umbraton. Without extracting their dirty hands, there wouldn\'t have been a new Umbraton.I will not deny my effort or the price I paid in giving Umbraton a new leash in life, but I am still incredibly grateful to the town folks for standing with me. They, too, wanted a better life. If they weren\'t willing to help themselves, I could not have pulled Umbraton out of the quagmire, no matter how hard I tried. I will take half of the credit; the other half belongs to everyone in Umbraton."},{"file_name":"His Story (III)","files":"The best thing about today\'s Umbraton is that it\'s escaped the pernicious elements. Life is still hard. Some are still homeless. Some still can\'t afford bread. However, the impetus for living is no longer the dangerous thrills, but the determination and courage to protect others, to improve oneself, and to get a new life. Connolly\'s coffee shop, Dayna\'s gang, and Sheol\'s guild all run on their own faith, as well as fearlessness. At a bare minimum, I\'m satisfied with what Umbraton is now. The least I can do is maintain the status quo and keep the poisons out of town.Eclipses are another threat to Umbraton. They always lurk and never, ever leave. I also understand, that because of the town\'s geographical location, it invariably is the first line of defense whenever the Eclipsites decide to invade Lumopolis. But we won\'t be fighting them for Lumopolis; we\'ll be fighting them for Umbraton.
