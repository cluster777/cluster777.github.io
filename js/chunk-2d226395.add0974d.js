They always use the money from their bounty to buy ice... Because of this, it seems like the temperature adjustment function is very attractive to them. They ignore the missions and bounties others offered them and came here specifically to look for clients, when the truth is, they just came here for the air conditioner.

Especially those mercenaries who looked at us like we were strange animals... Although we look a little peculiar, we are truly Aurorians... Later, we learned that the people here fought battles with guns and cannons. Many love their weapons and even name them. There were so many times when our employers underestimated us and didn\'t give us missions just because we didn\'t have any weapons in our hands... We didn\'t have any choice other than to follow the local customs here... So, we bought these two models from a group of weapon dealers...Everyone thought we used guns after that.

Oh, we always do this. We simply have to argue over trivial things like this. In short, we met at a place called Port Haste. That was a strange place as there was no water or any boats... Why is it called a port then?(Kuma interrupts: You are, digressing, from the subject, again).When I heard it was a port, I thought there would be a lake and that I could swim there. In the end, I realized that we had to slide down a tall snow slope!
