No, not exactly an explosion, but even worse... When I got there, I saw a short, black-haired girl holding a red-haired girl with double ponytails by her head, with the latter shouting, \\"Let me! Let me do it!\\" The sight woke me up right then and there. Aren\'t they Miss Curo and Miss Benny? It turned out they were only fighting over who got to do the introduction.

You wouldn\'t believe my rotten luck to have been paired up with her as soon as I joined Illumina... (Curo: That\'s my line.) To me, combat is nothing more than charging straight ahead. What\'s there to think about? I\'m the strongest, anyway, so I only have to worry about is how many I can kill! Curo, on the other hand, mulls over strategy, terrain, and whatnot. I just don\'t get that! At all! If I wasn\'t held back, I would\'ve fought her! (Curo: You can\'t beat me either way.)I never thought we\'d be partners.

However, I\'d take it easy on her once in a while to keep her confidence up. (Benny: What are you talking about? I win fair and square, don\'t even try to deny!) See, I knew she wouldn\'t believe I go easy on her. Ever since there have been more ties, she\'s gotten more and more insufferable. Guess I\'ll have to go all out now.

Why? I never did! I mean, it\'s not like I couldn\'t bring more with me! Even when I run out, I still got my hands! Even if I have nothing, I still got her! Anyway, the nagging has to stop...
