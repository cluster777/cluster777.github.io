Smokey was standing in the corridor, looking as though she was searching for more Fireflies to turn into fireballs. If I hadn\'t stopped her, she would have destroyed them all!Wild... That was my first impression of her. I later learned that Smokey mistook the Fireflies for enemy attackers... but why did she break into the Colossus in the first place? When I asked her, Smokey gave a simple two-word answer: for fun.She\'s a good person, despite being somewhat willful and unprincipled.

If we get the chance, I really should take you to look around.Speaking of Umbraton, there are all kinds of people there, all doing their best to live. To be precise, they\'re all trying to live in the moment. I don\'t have many friends and I met them all in Umbraton, one of them was Tessa.I was buying a lollipop when I met this cool girl... Don\'t get me wrong! I don\'t like candies. I just wanted the free ring that came with it, but she didn\'t even give me a chance to touch it! We ended up fighting on the street until Istvan showed up and broke it up. If he hadn\'t, the whole street would\'ve ended up a pile of rubble.After our little misunderstanding was resolved, I got to know Tessa. And later, she introduced me to some of her friends.

Once I fall asleep, I pretty much always snore. Will I end up burning something? Who\'s to say? It\'s just like when I first came to Umbraton, the hotel I stayed in was fine the night I arrived, but when I woke up the next day, the walls were gone. Just as I was trying to explain, the manager started yelling at me like a madman.I couldn\'t help but get a little mad, so I beat him up a bit. Then after he called his friends to come help him, I smashed up his friend\'s shop... and a bar, a cafe, a grocery store, a theater... When I was done smashing, someone told me that this was Istvan\'s territory. But Istvan was nice to me. After listening to my explanation, he didn\'t even ask me to pay for the damages! I later learned that he was the boss of Umbraton, and a true hero admired by all.

I grew up listening to the stories of the family elders, who told the tale of a Manticore ancestor who fought against an actual manticore, surviving its fiery breath and killing it. This hero then changed his surname and made this heirloom with the monster\'s skull. I must\'ve heard this story a thousand times each year... It was beyond annoying. They would also go on about how I was gifted with Lumina all the time and force me to practice this and that every day, which made me want to leave Petyaburg ever since I was a kid. So, after we got rid of those Eclipsites and made sure the Manticores were all okay, I took the brooch and left Petyaburg.Don\'t get me wrong! I didn\'t steal this family heirloom. Instead, they gave it to me! After all, I was the great pyromancer they\'d been training all those years."},{"file_name":"Her Story (IV)","files":"Since you have strong psychic abilities, do you know what my real talents are? A lot of people say I\'m some kind of genius with fire, but that\'s only part of the answer. I think my real talent lies in numbing my pain.When I was very young, I couldn\'t control the fiery power within me and often caused fires. My family soon found out about my gift and forced me into all kinds of training. However, I noticed that as the amount of training they piled on me increased, and the more intense it got, the less I was able to feel actual pain. It\'s like when you repeatedly hit the ground with your fist, it hurts at first but not so much after a while.This dulling of the senses started affecting other aspects of my life. Eventually, I felt like nothing in this world interested me anymore, so all I could do was wander around, looking for something to stimulate my mind. That\'s why everyone said I was wild and rebellious. If I were to live my life the way everyone else wanted me to live it, I might become a living dead.In my quest for excitement, I turned Petyaburg upside down. Many people just shook their heads when they saw me, and I even crashed the Lumopolis talent assessment! When Eclipsites attacked Petyaburg, I fought in the battle just for some fun, but then my family thought I was doing it to protect my home and gave me this manticore brooch. In the end, Petyaburg was way too small to satisfy me. All the people there thought in the same boring way... I left and came to Umbraton. This is the only place I could ever live. I mean, where else can you find new and exciting things happening every day?"}],"story":[],"voice":["Umbraton is full of noise, and there\'s plenty of fighting to be had there, but it\'s also filled with a sense of freedom as if every street is paved with opportunity.","Lumopolis is a place only a minority of old-fashioned nobles could ever find happiness.","Live for the moment.","That was pathetic! Not even enough for a warm-up!","If I hadn\'t come to Umbraton, I wouldn\'t have met Tessa. She\'s so cool! Nothing fazes her!","Conflict arises wherever you go, so you always need someone around to keep the peace. In Umbraton, that someone is Istvan.","Walking the line between life and death is more exciting than anything else in the world. That\'s why I love fighting!","I\'d rather die than live a life bound by rules!","I\'ve never seen anything so huge... I wonder what it\'s like to fly on it...","You think I\'ll just set fire to everything all the time? Okay, maybe I will, but not here!","You just want me to stand here for the others to gawk at? If anyone passes by, can I set them on fire?","Oh... I missed.","Too easy!","Where do you think you\'re going!?","Good night!","Watch this!","It\'s just another ordinary day.

The Fireflies can clean it up later.","The flames are rising.","Alchemy Stars.","Don\'t you ever change your clothes? Or perhaps you just own 300 identical outfits?","Stop pestering me with questions about this, that, and the other... You\'re like a child who doesn\'t understand a single thing!","Some people say my shoes are too loud when I walk... Well, too bad! I absolutely adore them!","Can I launch my fireballs at your Fireflies? They can fix themselves, anyway...","Imagine how amazing it would be to drop fireballs from the Colossus! Especially when we\'re chasing after Eclipsites!","See this flaming manticore? Isn\'t it beautiful?","I used to fight the Eclipsites alongside the nobles of Lumopolis. Haha, you didn\'t see that coming, did you?","Fires always seem to break out when I snore in the night... Please remember to warn the Fireflies!","I\'m part of the Manticore family. Haven\'t you heard of us? Never mind.","You look like you need a pick-me-up... How about I wash your face with fire? It won\'t hurt much.","Training? Not for me, thanks. Trust me, the power of fire comes from within.","I came across some beautiful accessories in Umbraton recently. How about we head back there and place an order?","Are there any battles planned for today?","The sun, it burns my eyes! Why didn\'t anyone close the curtain!?","A whole day went by and I didn\'t even get to do anything! I didn\'t even lay eyes on an Eclipsite, let alone fight one!","I like the night. It\'s peaceful... but it\'s also a little boring.","I\'m Smokey. Are you the owner of this Colossus? Where can I find some fun here, and more importantly, can I set on fire?","I\'ll take it!","You\'re too kind!","This is not bad...","Come on! You\'re after something, aren\'t you?","Burn, baby, burn!","Fire! The solution to all life\'s problems!","Let\'s go burn something!","If I didn\'t snore so much, maybe I never would\'ve met Istvan...","See this brooch?
