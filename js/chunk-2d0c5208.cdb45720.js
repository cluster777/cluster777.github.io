But Sork and Bekk, the crocodile and the bird, took it seriously. It\'s hard to imagine they actually tracked us for so long. Well, they realized after we met that the bounty was worthless when we finally convinced Sinsa to clear the issue up.

Where she lived has no name, because not even her parents know it, but they can actually live as long as anyone, and they supposedly enjoyed prestige in a certain small town, until the Eclipsites destroyed it all. Anyway, there went the happy times. To survive, Bekk\'s parents often went out scrounging for food, leaving Bekk alone in the nest. It was a big nest, but usually with just Bekk in it. So then came Bekk\'s friend Sork one day. That Sork wasn\'t me. It was another birdie. But birdie Sork and bird Bekk\'s parents got killed by the Eclipsites. Birdie Bekk\'s parents pushed her out of the next to save her, and birdie Sork took the falling rocks for her so they wouldn\'t knock her out... She was unfortunate. —Sork"},{"file_name":"Their Story (III)","files":"My name didn\'t use to be Sork but Gana.
