Like them, we enjoyed the civilians\' respect and tributes, but I don\'t believe it\'s a one-way street, as we also need to uphold our obligations, whether it be protecting them or mediating their disputes.

All nobles have the power granted by their bloodline, and that is the very thing allowing them to be nobles and to protect commoners.

You just have to trust me.","Am I not strong enough...","This is my mission.","Final blow!","Secure peace!","Show me the way.","It\'s New Year. Make a wish.","Always standing by.","It can be improved.","This is the power I deserve.","Let the spear pierce the night sky...","Is it break time? As an excellent warrior of Lumopolis, having too much free time doesn\'t seem proper. However, I am indeed in need of some rest.","There are no limits!","Alchemy Stars!","As a noble of Lumopolis, I must protect people like you... Don\'t you need my protection? I underestimated you.","You can practice dart throwing with me if you have nothing else to do... What are you getting so excited for? I just need you to hold the board for me.","Is my hobby old-fashioned? There\'s nothing wrong with having a thing for traditional opera the way I see it. As a noble, I should take cultural heritage seriously.","I take the lightning spear as my weapon because I\'m good with spears, which are the only kind of weapon that match my status as an excellent warrior.","Are you questioning the accuracy of the lightning spear? Don\'t worry about it. I can pierce anything with either a dart or a lightning spear, even mosquito wings if I want to.","Be careful. The lightning bolts surrounding me are not just decoration.","As a noble, I must act like one. I will stand on my dignity but I will not try to establish supremacy over everyone, including you.","There were times when I was overly haughty... But it was due to my status and ability. Making immediate changes isn\'t easy for me. Please don\'t take it the wrong way.","I wonder why... but I feel like I can be who I am inside when I\'m with you.","I might have cared too much about my status. But people are born unequal.","All those common people lacking sound judgment should just sit and wait to be protected, shouldn\'t they?","Battles and training are part of my daily life. You don\'t need to worry about me.","There you are. It\'s my daily training time. I mean... I\'m practicing darts now.","There\'s no need for greetings. It\'s unnecessary to waste time on that.","It\'s not late for a warrior.","A good sleeping pattern is necessary for maintaining good health.","Nice to meet you. My name is Beverly. I will be working with you this time. As a member of the Lumopolis Guard, it is my responsibility to protect the common people here. Rest assured.","Hmm, I\'ll take it.","I really appreciate your consideration.","Oh, what a perfect present for me! Thank you.","Thank you... Looks like I need to be more attentive to you.","Pierce it, lightning spear!","Impeccable!","I have a clear shot!","My family is a distinguished and powerful one. We enjoy the respect of the common people, so naturally, we will die to protect them. This is the pride and responsibility my family cleaves to.","Unlike the so-called nobles, who live lavish lifestyles, I am committed to my duty and responsibility of maintaining order and peace... But what about them? Do they even deserve their titles?","My father said I would sooner or later suffer losses because of my hauteur. I had known about this problem a long time ago, but hauteur is in my blood, so it\'s hard for me to change...","Stand behind me!"],"skins":[],"description":"One of the militant nobles in Lumopolis, enjoying great prestige and power.
