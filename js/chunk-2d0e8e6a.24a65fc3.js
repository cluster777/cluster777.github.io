He was a simple man with simple ambitions, and my mother lived a life of quiet seclusion... The very idea of them rebelling against anything was preposterous.<br><br>But Lumopolis is a land of justice. Hah—justice! I watched my parents as they were put in restraints.

It was given to me when I entered the academy—it was a gift the temple gives each student who dreams of becoming a nun and represents their faith in the temple\'s teachings. Therefore, after I was expelled from the temple, I held onto it because, at that time, I thought that I would one day return there and achieve my dream of becoming a nun.<br><br>Looking at the emblem in my hand, dripping with blood because of how tightly I had clutched it, I knew I could never return to Lumopolis. The emblem seemed to reflect my mentality at that moment perfectly. Originally, the insignia on it belonged to Lumopolis Temple. Now, it had become an insignia I didn\'t know, but one that undoubtedly belonged to me and not Lumopolis. On that night, my hair turned white. Since then, I have understood that I am innately different from all Lumopolis stands for and will never become a nun."}],"story":[],"voice":["There is no real truth in this world.
