I\'m the only one doing the stakeout. You see these dark circles?","The Illumina guys have been trying hard to get my gun and study it. Like I\'m gonna let that happen! What a bunch of crazy geeks!","Let\'s give those bullies a taste of what it\'s like to be rubbed against the ground.","As long as I have my gun, I\'ll kill all the Eclipsites that come my way and send them home for good.","That giant lizard! I hate to say it, but it\'s sort of cute... Huh? What? Did I say anything?","I haven\'t seen that bear-and-penguin pair for a long time. Are they still looking for air conditioners? I\'ll give them some parts if the chance comes.","Control yourself, Kafka... I\'ll get back to petting the fluffy fellas later on...","The noise! The noise! How come there\'s not even a single quiet bed to sleep in the great, big Rediesel desert?","How gigantic this fella is! They say it has its own consciousness. Just get it to do the stakeout then if so.","No animals here? Great! Ah, but it\'s kinda boring...","You want me to do the stakeout? Fine. I\'m always up all night anyway.","That was too stressful. I was off my game...","A piece of cake.","Super electric field! Scatter shot!","Close-range shot!","Searching for enemies...","Like I\'m gonna say it... Ahem. Happy New Year.","Spare no foes!","Franz! Go!","Let\'s use more powerful bullets!","Shoot! Shoot like crazy!","I\'m gonna take a nap. You! Take those animals away. Don\'t disturb me.","Faster and more precise.","Alchemy Stars!","Don\'t talk to me when I just wake up. I\'ll so groggy the whole world is my enemy.","Keep those fluffy things away from me if possible.","Don\'t know where that Franz is again. That\'s for the best, I guess.","Someone\'s bullying a puppy? Take me there. I\'m gonna have that fellow live a life without hands...","We must check the bullets thoroughly. They tend to get stuck when we blast those who attack small animals...","I\'ve got a better gun now. I\'m gonna aim for those despicable beings -- the Eclipsites, the noisemakers, and the torturers of small animals.","Fluffy or not, whoever disturbs me will get shot and that includes you.","These fellows always make me do the stakeout alone. You there! Take my place.","Whoever disturbs my sleep will receive the Eclipsites treatment, including you.","You\'re tired? But you can\'t rest now. I stay up late all the time.","This annoying little thing\'s rubbing against me again! Kafka, you have to stop being such a softie...","Gotta take a break every once in a while. Where\'s Franz? Franz! Didn\'t I tell you to always stay close to me!?","Now is when those fluffy fellas are most active. Watch them! Don\'t let them wander off!","How dare you disturb my rest! Oh... it\'s morning. Looks like I pulled an all-nighter again.","No one\'s coming for the next shift? What a bunch of slackers! Someday, I\'m gonna shoot them in the middle of the night...","I\'m exhausted. That\'s it. I\'m done with this shift. Gonna get some sleep!","The name\'s Kafka. I have three requests: Don\'t get me to do the stakeout, get me a soundproof studio apartment for singles, and drive these animals away from me!","A gift for me? Fine, I\'ll take it.","Looks like it\'s worth a fortune. Thanks!","This gift looks pretty nice...","This? Wow! Thanks so much!","Fire!","Nowhere to hide!","Gauss rifle! Aim!","Rediesel Wrench? I didn\'t want to join them initially, but that giant lizard just made it too hard to refuse.","Wanna know how I managed to get this rifle? That\'s an interesting story, but before that, please drive these clingy little fellas away first.","My home used to be a little castle, not this giant lizard. If it wasn\'t for the Eclipsites... Hmm... Don\'t feel like talking about it anymore. I\'m gonna sleep.","I\'ll watch them like a hawk."],"skins":[],"description":"A Rediesel Wrench sniper wielding a powerful super railgun to annihilate all opposing foes.","realName":"Kafka","nickname":"Super Electron","gender":"Female","height":"5\'5\\"","birthday":"February 6","birthplace":"Fort Brig","style":"Super Electron, Electromagnetic Rifle"}')}}]);
