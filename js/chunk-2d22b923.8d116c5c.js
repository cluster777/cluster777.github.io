I get chills down my spine just watching him sitting over there.

He doesn\'t like to talk. Instead, he just sits in the corner and watches everyone else. To be honest with you, when I think of his lifeless eyes watching me on the ship, I start to tremble.But we need Hydrad, not only because his shadow magic is powerful and useful, but also because of his calmness, intelligence, and judgment. Coincidentally he was also interested in this place—to be precise, he was interested in the people who appeared here. I think you can see this from how the Shadow Wolf beside him acts...

All sorts of interesting people are here, bringing many interesting missions with them.Shadows don\'t have a heartbeat. When I became aware of this, I realized that I had been immersed in this magic for so long that I could barely feel my own heartbeat. Only interesting missions and exciting sports make me feel like I\'m not a shadow. Because of that, I joined that gang in Umbraton because I would get plenty of opportunities to play my, ahem, sport.

When I was very young, my mother let me crawl everywhere on the street by myself... She wasn\'t worried in the slightest that I would be hit by a galloping carriage. Maybe she was even hoping this would happen so she could swindle money from her poor victim. My father always wanted to sell me, and it was just that he wasn\'t able to find a good buyer—he admitted this himself. He could even leave and have someone replace him. I was like a dog that stayed beside them, begging for food every so often. I would take whatever I could get, and would even sleep with my eyes half open.In the end, they got sick of me. On a cloudy day as a cold gale was blowing through the border, they offered me a hot drink—something they rarely did. That was the last cup of sweet water I ever tasted. While I was drinking that cup of sweet water, they walked into a carriage, closed the door, and left for Lumopolis.I was free after that, though no one fed me anymore, Still, I have my companion, that black dog."},{"file_name":"His Story (III)","files":"I rescued that black dog when I was still a dog. We were both dogs, so I thought we might be able to understand each other. I realized after I saved him though, that we are actually different. He is a black wolf.He saved me several times. We joined the gang in Umbraton by accident, but I was able to live a decent life there because of his help. I even gained my Shadow Wolf abilities because of him... I don\'t get it, but he seems to have some complex feelings about the Eclipsites.Want to know where he\'s gone now?Didn\'t you see those Shadow Wolves just now?"},{"file_name":"His Story (IV)","files":"I returned to Umbraton after the war and hung out with various gangs. I actually didn\'t really care where I was as long as I wasn\'t bothered. I grew up in Umbraton, anyway, so it was fine with me...But I went to Lumopolis by chance with a certain gang one time and saw those two. I had thought they would live a better life after abandoning me, but there was the woman, kissing up to someone who obviously served a noble. Maybe they think currying favors from servants in Lumopolis is better than struggling to make a living here.I\'d rather just call her a woman. You\'re not expecting me to call her \\"Mother\\", are you?"}],"story":[],"voice":["There was time that people like me are fit for only Umbraton. Now, it\'s people like me should be in Umbraton.","Lumopolis... Anyone who wants to can go there, but I\'m not interested.","Tsk, the shadows are always watching you.","Eclipsites? Should I care about them? My shadows will swarm and surround them, gnawing them to death. The end.","Don\'t know, don\'t care. The one in Umbraton is an octopus, something that should have gone extinct ages ago.","Tsk, I don\'t know why that long worm gets so fired up every day...","Likes? Hmm... Spicy food, hounds, and no one bothering me.","I dislike those who think they know everything.","Is this your home? It doesn\'t matter. I have stayed overnight at someone else\'s place before.","How troublesome... Just give up. I won\'t react to it.","Please get someone else instead if possible. Even my hounds refuse to stay here.","Are you frustrated? Sorry, but I don\'t care.","Those are called weaklings.","Shred!","Devour!","I am your master!","Tsk, it\'s New Year now; so what?","Listen to me. Get someone else.","They gather on the other side of Light.","They have descended silently.","Devour those who are addicted to false pleasures!","Wow, hmm, whatever... I\'m so bored... Will someone please put an end to everything?","Fine, you are accepted.","Alchemy Stars.","You seem to be able to talk to them... Many people end up going mad. Don\'t mind it, it\'s nothing.","Say what you want to say; I\'m listening. Before the boss returns, I have all the time in the world to pretend to be listening to you.","Existence is meaningless, especially when you understand its meaning. You don\'t get it? That\'s normal. Even the boss don\'t get it.","Just like how shadows overlap, darkness gathers and becomes denser... That thing that was cut off and regenerated is about to collapse. You don\'t need to know about this.","It doesn\'t matter whether it is a hound or a wolf, or whether it is a shadow or something real. You don\'t need to be interested in this... Just look at it.","Do you see them? They are beautiful, quiet, and everywhere. The one behind you is the same yet completely different.","You have nothing to worry about if you have doubts about my ability. I have more important things to do than to use shadows to deal with you.","Hmm... I think I\'m starting to appreciate you. Do you know that your shadow has a scent now? Stay away from me. I don\'t want to smell it.","I don\'t want to admit it, but you\'re similar to big bro. You\'re both masters of shadows and walk freely among shadows in the world of light and darkness.","Now what? You must be here for something, right?","This place is more boring than I expected... Aren\'t you the master of this place? Do something.","Stay away... My shadows are feeling agitated and I don\'t care if they bite you.","Oh, you\'re back. I thought you had gone missing.","You\'re diligent, but so what? It has nothing to do with me...","Are you going out or not? Make it snappy and stop wasting time.","Why are you still awake when even my hounds are asleep? Whatever... I\'m not waiting for you... What else are you going to do?","I didn\'t expect that you could find me. It\'s such a pain to introduce myself. Just read this for yourself.","Oh. Wow. A gift... I REALLY wanted this...","Tsk, fine, I\'ll take it. OH SO HAPPY I AM.","...Ha! Did you make a lucky guess? I\'m kind of looking forward to this.","You know what I want, just like usual.","Disperse the light!","Tear Light apart!!","Welcome the color of death—","Many things are unimportant to me, like clothes and relatives. They\'ll all leave sooner or later. Don\'t try to refute me because I\'m right.","Bonds are simply ridiculous. People who want you to pursue something unrealistic inject this notion into your head and imprison you with it. Sorry, but I\'m not going to believe in it.","I won\'t rule out the possibility that I\'ll end up in a very cliché situation one day, but it\'s highly unlikely. Just wait and see. That\'s all the files. Stop tapping. That\'s all. Geez!","Captain? Seriously?"],"skins":[],"description":"This guy from Umbraton isn\'t one who hangs around with gangs. In fact, he\'s a lone wolf.
