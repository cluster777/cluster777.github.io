Oh, and I got cheated out of money, too. Hard for me to imagine people would do things like that. Fortunately, there\'s Miss Sheol... She\'s very nice. If she didn\'t offer me work and overlook my clumsy nature, I would\'ve starved to death by now!"},{"file_name":"Her Story (IV)","files":"I don\'t know if we talked about this before, but the reason I have OCD is because of my powers. I usually use \\"Dark Water\\" for attacking, but \\"Pure Water\\" for healing. Sounds useful, right? The problem is, if I wanted to keep attacking or healing, I must balance it with the other power. Otherwise, the murky water would confuse my mind and cause me to attack or heal at random. It\'s okay if it\'s healing, but if it\'s an attack... No problem against an enemy, but big trouble if it\'s an ally. The powers likely made me irrationally focused on balancing everything in life perfectly, and before long, I had OCD... It may also be because I\'m not strong enough. If I get better, maybe I can control it, right?"}],"story":[],"voice":["I don\'t like Umbraton, but I have no choice... I have to go through here to get to Lumopolis.","Illumina is a great place. It\'s nice to see everyone working towards the same goal...","I\'m with Murky Water.","Why do these things even exist...","Areia\'s a mature child. She\'s really something. I want to help her as much as I can.","If it wasn\'t for Ms. Sheol, I probably wouldn\'t have been able to survive in Umbraton.","Cats are cute, especially the black ones! I just love their eyes...","When I first arrived in Umbraton, I met a lot of bad guys who deceived me. I don\'t ever want to see them again.","With this... I should be able to enter and exit Lumopolis at will...","What can I do for you? I\'d like to rest for a while...","Me? I might screw things up.

I\'m beginning to miss my home in Illumina.","I must find Gabriel to ask about my grandfather...","I\'ve recently found myself to be more skilled at using Murky Water. It\'s difficult to balance my ability to control...","I should learn to fight the side effects that come with this ability. The problem is that nobody knows how it works. I can do nothing but sit by and let chaos soil my mind.","You\'re a genuine child. I can feel it.","I\'ll buy you coffee sometime... I assume you don\'t like bitter coffee, so I\'ve prepared some sugar for you.","Have you ever had this feeling before? The kind that makes you feel... that evil is gradually invading your mind and body. I fear I\'m wasting too much time on things of no importance. I should utilize my power more efficiently! Ah... No, forget it.","I had the room transformed so that it has a symmetrical structure. Now it\'s so much more comfortable to stay in.","I didn\'t think it would be so spacious in the Colossus.
