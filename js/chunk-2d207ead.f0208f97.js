Although I heard I was born in a noble family, I didn\'t feel that way. Later on, I lived with my relatives because my parents had to go out to work. I lived in a small room since I was a child, and I rarely went out... because they refused to let me go out. My only company was this clarinet, so I played it and played it. Sometimes I\'m afraid to play it loudly because I feared I would be disturbing others for being too noisy. So, I pretended to play it and pretended that there was sound.Over time, it really did make sounds! The door of that small room opened, and they came in to chat with me. I was quite terrified at first—not of them because they didn\'t have malicious intentions. I was afraid that they would be discovered by my relatives...Oh! I said too much again. In short, they came often to keep me company. T-that\'s all."},{"file_name":"Her Story (III)","files":"I am very grateful to my aunt. Although she was very harsh on me, she also raised me well... If it wasn\'t because my cousin slandered my parents, I would have tried to continue to endure everything... At that time, Anton—those friends of mine—could sense that I was sad and became even angrier than me.They asked me to play my clarinet and clamored about teaching my cousin a lesson. So, I tried responding to them... But they actually appeared! They even knocked my cousin out for me! Although I couldn\'t stay at my aunt\'s house after that, I felt more at ease with Anton than l did at her house...You see, this is what they look like. Don\'t you think they are quite soft and lovely?"},{"file_name":"Her Story (IV)","files":"I wanted to ask Grandma Sophia for help after I left my aunt\'s house... However, thinking about my aunt and cousin, I felt that I should not bring trouble to Grandma Sophia, so I was constantly in hiding. But one day, my cousin actually caused trouble at the cafe I worked at.I felt really guilty at that time... I rushed over there, only to see that person appear like a god and save Grandma Sophia. After that... I came here as you probably know. Not only can Anton protect me now, but he can also protect Grandma Sophia and everyone else...I can do all these things now, so I want to help everyone as much as possible. Although I\'m still a little clumsy and still cause trouble now and then... but... I\'ll definitely become an independent person one day!"}],"story":[],"voice":["Under the shadow of Azurite, Umbraton is a blend of order and chaos...
