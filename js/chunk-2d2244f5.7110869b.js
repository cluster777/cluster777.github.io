You want me to watch over you! Would you be bored to death otherwise?","Retreat, but we\'ll be back!","This bunch of garbage is no match for me!","Sherman - Modified!","Down with all of you!","Lock and loaded.","New Year\'s here!","Yes!","My sword has become sharper.","Old soldiers never die.","I alone am a legion!","What a great weekend! Did you come to play chess with me? No? Then leave me alone to play solo.","Let me beat them back!","Alchemy Stars!","What\'s the ironjaw for? The last person asking about it had his head cracked like a walnut, that\'s what it\'s for!","Why don\'t you give Colossus a feminine name? That way, you will never leave her alone on the battlefield.","Think I\'m ridiculous!? Only God knows who else awaits us in the future. War is constantly around us!","Never kill someone with a knife when a gun will do. I\'ll ask Gronru for some armor-piercing rounds later and blow them to hell.","More training leads to less dying in battles.","People said bullets could hit anyone. What a pity they always ducked me, ha!","Nice weather today. Why don\'t you come on a cross-country training with me?","No one will treat you fairly and equally in a battle. Use whatever dirty tricks it takes to win! How about I show you some of them?","Let\'s see your battle face... What? That\'s the best you can do? Ha! Such a newbie!","I heard the rookie camp in the Enlightenment is regressing from bad to worse. Are the drill instructors doing nothing at all? At this pace, they\'ll end up being nothing more than live targets in a fight!","If you\'re that bored, get some training in so you won\'t drop the ball at crunch time.","Soldiers are nothing without war. I definitely do not want to be a parasite that contributes nothing.","It\'s too quiet around here. I wanna shoot something!!","Get up, ya lazy bum! This is not your grandma\'s comfy, cozy house!","It\'s been a day and no enemy in sight. I\'m bored! Go get me an eclipsite or two to fight!","It\'s been a long time since I trained overnight… Since you\'re here, should we do it together?","I heard there are many battles to fight! I\'m Barton, legion commander of the Enlightenment Federation Army. Let\'s go take out the trash right now!","Ah, thank you.","This is extremely valuable. I\'ll take it.","Not bad. I\'ll consider using it.","Haha! This is as satisfying as fighting!","I\'ll end you with Barton\'s Army Sword!","Come shower in my bullets!","It\'s party time!","The battles now are cakewalks compared to a few years back... That was a real war! I\'ll tell you about it someday.","Only war can turn me into a legion commander at my age. Pango, on the other hand, wasn\'t so lucky. Somebody\'s bound to take a bullet in a fight, you know.","Don\'t underestimate the Four Angels of Lumopolis. Those lasses fight like tigers. I got to figure out how to neutralize them...","Follow me and kill them all!"],"skins":[{"name":"Harbored Regret","description":"\\"Sergeant Hvit! Sergeant Ulv!
