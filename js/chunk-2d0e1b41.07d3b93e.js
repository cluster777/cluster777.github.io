After all, I never saw one.","What are you doing here? Want to get a taste of electric current?","Fine. I don\'t know what I should do, but I\'ll do it anyway.","Now, this is interesting.","Well, I was kind of fired up.","It\'s too weak.","I\'ve got this.","As fast as a lightning.","Happy New Year, I hope everyone will grow in some ways.","No other choice.","It\'s so hard to control this power.","It would be bad news for enemies if my power went out of control, wouldn\'t it?","Lightning is leaping out of my hand, haha.","Whew... how easy is life...","It\'s kind of nice.","Alchemy Stars.","Yeah? Do you mind? If there\'s nothing else, please leave me alone.","The Colossus is not the only monstrosity to fly in the sky. See that floating island? You need an airship to get there.","I don\'t like to be in contact with people. There are just too many annoying people... Anyway, why am I even bringing this up?","When I\'m alone, I have more time to think, and I get to think about many things I wouldn\'t normally think about.","Have you ever pondered the meaning of this power? I thought about everything we have on occasions, and they\'re more a curse than a gift.","The life of getting into fights everywhere is not as interesting as I thought it would be. Maybe it\'s because I was never a combative child, until that day.","You\'re a decent guy, and I\'m starting to take interest in Caelestites. But others, however... Oh, I don\'t mean anything by it. Don\'t take it personal.","I don\'t feel strongly about anything in life, so I can\'t give you any advice... Just look out for yourself more.","I only have a few friends, but all of us understand each other very well, and that\'s what I want.","I\'m about to go get some rest. If there\'s anything you want to talk to me about, do it later.","This big fellow... He\'s called Soroz, isn\'t he? I\'d love to talk to him.","It\'s much quieter here than where I live at. I\'m not really used to it.","Oh, you\'re here? Nothing has happened here so far. I\'m having a really easy time.","You\'re really hardworking, but you should remember to maintain a healthy work-life balance.","Relax, you\'re off duty.","You want to burn yourself out? I won\'t stop you anyway...","My name\'s Tessa. For the record, it is certainly important for us to cooperate, but I still hope that you would mind your own business, and I, mine.","Nice stuff. I\'ll take it.","I\'ll remember you being so nice to me.","I didn\'t think that you\'d actually get me.","I see you know I like this...","This is going to hurt a little.","Electrolyze!","Let\'s give it a go.","I had never thought of using my powers to destroy anyone before, let alone the people of Lumopolis. To be honest, I didn\'t even understand what Richard meant by hatred.","Most people think I hate Lumopolis, but that\'s not true. Richard, who raised me, is the one who hates it, but he has never let his hatred affect me.","I do need this power to protect myself, but looking at my growing power, I feel an indescribable void. Is there an end to all of these?","Just fight with little effort."],"skins":[],"description":"An ally of the Spearows in Umbraton, she\'s a free-spirit known for her lollipops and the electricity shooting from her hands.","realName":"Tessa","nickname":"Hyper Volt","gender":"Female","height":"5\'4\\"","birthday":"May 2","birthplace":"Umbraton","style":"Electrotechno, Electricity Control"}')}}]);
