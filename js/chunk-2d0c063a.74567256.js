Whenever he rescued an animal, I would log the dates, symptoms, recovery, death, etc. until I was no longer satisfied with only that and started recording information about the species, height, shape, voice, lifespan, and so on.

I had nowhere to go but the desert. The Rediesel Desert was completely different from the cold, damp Northland I was accustomed to, so the arid heat was difficult to adjust to. Luckily, my father\'s training helped and I gradually acclimated, thanks to the stamina I\'ve developed over the years. Even then, I still suffered much hardship. Often without food, water, or weapons, I had to evade wild predators as well as Eclipsites. But do you know what I found? A hunting rifle with its former owner\'s blood still on it...

I have seriously considered a suggestion from Louise and find a place for myself, set up a big shelf for all the notebooks I\'ll collect.
