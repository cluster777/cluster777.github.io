Is that \\"Lumopolis Temple Scriptures\\"?"},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"Yes."},{"char":"Paloma:","dialogue":"How strange. Why would you want to read such a book all of a sudden?"},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"Ahaha... I\'m a little embarrassed to say..."},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"It\'s basically because I\'ve never read a book about theology or religion before."},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"Carleen recommended this book to me. She said that almost everyone has a copy in Lumopolis."},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"So, I thought it might be a good idea to use this book as an introduction to religion."},{"char":"Paloma:","dialogue":"I see."},{"char":"Paloma:","dialogue":"Do you actually know what lies within the pages of this book, Caelestite?"},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"Erm... Not yet."},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"But I\'m guessing it contains some interesting legends or stories?"},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"Like the ancient battle of good and evil, the 72 Lost Sons of Light..."},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"... or legends of old Lumopolis and the God and Goddess of Light?"},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"After all, Lumopolis has so many impressive things to offer, so I\'m guessing its religious myths are probably quite elaborate, right?"},{"char":"Paloma:","dialogue":"..."},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"Why are you looking at me like that? Isn\'t that what this book is about?"},{"char":"Paloma:","dialogue":"Do you really have such high expectations for this book?"},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"Well...

Aren\'t you going to tell me about the stories in the book?"},{"char":"Paloma:","dialogue":"Quiet."},{"char":"Paloma:","dialogue":"You have to understand this, in a place like Lumopolis, we first need to specify the different classes."},{"char":"Paloma:","dialogue":"Thus, the distinction between civilians and nobles emerged."},{"char":"Paloma:","dialogue":"Nobles, of course, hold a very different status from most others. This is an indisputable fact."},{"char":"Paloma:","dialogue":"Now, let\'s get to the meat of the matter."},{"char":"Paloma:","dialogue":"Our story revolves around two noble families—Family A and Family B."},{"char":"Paloma:","dialogue":"Family A sought to find a way to make their daughter accept the grace of the God of Light."},{"char":"Paloma:","dialogue":"And so, they decided that sending her to the Lumopolis Temple to become a nun would be a wise choice."},{"char":"Paloma:","dialogue":"Chaste, pious, sacred, unaffected by the outside world, and not at all influenced by secular life."},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"So... What do nuns do, exactly?"},{"char":"Paloma:","dialogue":"That\'s a very good question."},{"char":"Paloma:","dialogue":"Nuns must confess their sins, lay deceased Aurorians to rest, and suffer for the Lord\'s inaction."},{"char":"Paloma:","dialogue":"The most important thing is that they firmly adhere to the beliefs and doctrine of the God of Light."},{"char":"Paloma:","dialogue":"All of a nun\'s beliefs come from this book—the Lumopolis Temple Scriptures."},{"char":"Paloma:","dialogue":"What is your opinion on the God of Light?"},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"Ah! Erm... Well..."},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"The God of Light... I always hear people mention that name... I suppose it\'s..."},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"Some kind of powerful god?"},{"char":"Paloma:","dialogue":"Do you believe there are gods in this world?"},{"char":"Paloma:","dialogue":"Anyway, you clearly know nothing about religion. Let\'s go on with the story."},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"..."},{"char":"Paloma:","dialogue":"Family A and Family B lived in harmony, studying magic together, and relying on each other for mutual benefit."},{"char":"Paloma:","dialogue":"Lumopolis officials are very wary of those who go against the teachings of the God of Light."},{"char":"Paloma:","dialogue":"In order to dispel the concerns of the upper class, the two families conducted their research with complete transparency..."},{"char":"Paloma:","dialogue":"Finally, under the guidance of the God of Light, a breakthrough was made."},{"char":"Paloma:","dialogue":"They sang to the heavens, praising the White Night, and reveling in their faith."},{"char":"Paloma:","dialogue":"The fates of the two families were inseparable, forever entwined."},{"char":"Paloma:","dialogue":"The young nun from Family A we mentioned earlier was also very pleased with this revelation."},{"char":"Paloma:","dialogue":"Because she knew that this blessing was truly the will of the God of Light."},{"char":"Paloma:","dialogue":"From then on, her faith became even more resolute, and she vowed to use every waking moment to carry out her duties as a nun."},{"char":"Paloma:","dialogue":"Forever."},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"..."},{"char":"Paloma:","dialogue":"What\'s the matter?"},{"char":"Paloma:","dialogue":"You look as though you have something to say."},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"Forever... just seems a little unrealistic."},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"It\'s the kind of word you only see in fairy tales."},{"char":"Paloma:","dialogue":"You\'re right.

I\'ll tell you what I think of the book once I finish reading it!"},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"Last time, you told me a story about a nun and her family!"},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"A story about the God of Light\'s grace, the sincere cooperation between two families, and a happy ending."},{"char":"Paloma:","dialogue":"Well, after listening to my story, you read the book for yourself, didn\'t you?"},{"char":"Paloma:","dialogue":"Would you now think that this book met your expectations?"},{"char":"Paloma:","dialogue":"Or did you prefer the God and Goddess of Light?"},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"Erm... Well..."},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"Actually... I didn\'t quite get it..."},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"This book is just full of complicated religious doctrines... But it did help me get to sleep."},{"char":"Paloma:","dialogue":"Indeed."},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"And... I don\'t understand how the contents of this book have anything to do with the story you told me last time?"},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"There\'s nothing about a young nun or two families in the book..."},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"This book is basically a tribute, singing the praises of the God of Light."},{"char":"Paloma:","dialogue":"This is because that happy tale does not exist."},{"char":"Paloma:","dialogue":"It\'s just that the last time I saw you looked so excited about reading it, so I told a story that was in line with its core concept."},{"char":"Paloma:","dialogue":"Unfortunately, it is a completely erroneous concept."},{"char":"Paloma:","dialogue":"Now, I hope you\'re ready to face the reality—"},{"char":"Paloma:","dialogue":"After all, the more beautiful a story is, the better it can obscure the darkness of reality."},{"char":"Paloma:","dialogue":"And the better it can convey how laughable this book really is."},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"The darkness of reality?"},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"So... That story from last time wasn\'t just a simple story, was it?"},{"char":"Paloma:","dialogue":"Of course it wasn\'t. Now, I will reveal the dark ending to you."},{"char":"Paloma:","dialogue":"Let us return to the beginning of the \\"cooperation\\" between Family A and B."},{"char":"Paloma:","dialogue":"Though they possessed similar power, they held diametrically opposed views on how to use that power."},{"char":"Paloma:","dialogue":"In order to achieve their magical breakthrough, Family A committed a contemptible crime."},{"char":"Paloma:","dialogue":"Their shameful deed was eventually made public, the momentum of which was impossible to quash."},{"char":"Paloma:","dialogue":"Lumopolis, in the name of the God of Light, was punished, as were Families A and B."},{"char":"Paloma:","dialogue":"The God of Light abandoned them, as they were unworthy to stand in his glory."},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"This story... sounds familiar..."},{"char":"Paloma:","dialogue":"The young nun of Family A was not spared.

Understanding? Forgiveness? The nun saw none of these. All she saw was..."},{"char":"Paloma:","dialogue":"A blind ruthlessness that crushed her faith."},{"char":"Paloma:","dialogue":"And so, the nun abided by the Lumopolis Temple Scriptures, only to have her family slain as a result."},{"char":"Paloma:","dialogue":"And now you know. That same book, the very same doctrine—"},{"char":"Paloma:","dialogue":"The tale and reality have entirely different endings. Tales are tales, but reality is a different story."},{"char":"Paloma:","dialogue":"And that\'s all there is to say about this book."},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"Lumopolis Temple Scriptures..."},{"char":"Paloma:","dialogue":"You have the strangest look on your face right now...
