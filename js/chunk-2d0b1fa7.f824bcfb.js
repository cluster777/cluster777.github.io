The name the Queen gave me was simply unacceptable, so I decided to change my name! But my mother did leave me the name, Sekar... I never met my mother. I heard that she died after giving birth to me and naming me Sekar. I only have one piece of memory of my parents, and in it, my parents were running non-stop because our tribe was under attack, and my father had died to protect my mother from being shot instead of dying from a sudden illness... However, I\'ve never read anything about this or heard anyone say anything related. Could it really just be a dream?My negative emotions start to break out of my control whenever I recall this memory... Because I\'m worried that I\'ll lose control again, I tell myself all the time to stop thinking about it... Urgh, but I can\'t help it sometimes. They\'re my parents after all...Speaking of it, I feel that we\'ve been talking more often. Is it because you\'re very reliable?"}],"voice":["Life at Illumina\'s Undercity may seem stressful to others, but it\'s actually tidy and orderly!","Lumopolis is said to have a unique way of resolving emotional issues.
