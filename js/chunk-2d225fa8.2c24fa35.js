Commander Hiiro?"},{"char":"Hiiro:","dialogue":"Yes, these are absolutely Cloud Mountain\'s sparklers."},{"char":"Hiiro:","dialogue":"It sounds very similar to firing a weapon, but it is for amusement, and nothing else."},{"char":"Hiiro:","dialogue":"I brought a few, so everyone can try them out."},{"char":"Tweety:","dialogue":"Heehee! These are the sparkwers we bwought from Cloud Mountain!"},{"char":"Tweety:","dialogue":"Give them a twy!

I totally agree."},{"char":"Vice:","dialogue":"I never would\'ve guessed something made up of gunpowder and fuses could be anything but a weapon..."},{"char":"Vice:","dialogue":"Back in school, I knew these as the basic components for weapons..."},{"char":"Vice:","dialogue":"Firearms, cannons... those kinds of stuff."},{"char":"Vice:","dialogue":"But to create something entirely different out of the same features..."},{"char":"Vice:","dialogue":"To be able to light its fuse and use it for something completely unrelated to war or weaponry..."},{"char":"Vice:","dialogue":"It gives off such a beautiful light, too."},{"char":"Vice:","dialogue":"Look! It burns even brighter when it\'s about to go out!"},{"char":"Vice:","dialogue":"As if... a tiny life is dancing in my hands..."},{"char":"Vice:","dialogue":"Warm, beautiful, and full of energy..."},{"char":"Vice:","dialogue":"If only I could stop time, right here and now, and cherish this moment forever."},{"char":"Vice:","dialogue":"Tweety, Hiiro, and all of these beautiful fireworks..."},{"char":"Vice:","dialogue":"And you, Navigator."},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"(Ah...)"},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"(If you really want to freeze this moment in time...)"},{"char":"Vice:","dialogue":"Oh...

Thank you for the compliment, Tweety!"},{"char":"Vice:","dialogue":"But I think the thing that made me feel the happiest..."},{"char":"Vice:","dialogue":"Was seeing the Navigator completely fail at lighting sparklers!"},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"...You didn\'t exactly get it on the first try either, Vice..."},{"char":"Vice:","dialogue":"Yeah, but details don\'t matter! What matters is that I did it!"},{"char":"Hiiro:","dialogue":"It\'s getting late."},{"char":"Hiiro:","dialogue":"We still have to return in the morning, Vice."},{"char":"Vice:","dialogue":"Oh yeah, you have a point..."},{"char":"Hiiro:","dialogue":"Let\'s go."},{"char":"Vice:","dialogue":"Then I guess Commander Hiiro and I are going back to our room, Navigator!"},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"Sure.
