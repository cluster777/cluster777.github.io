Perhaps I\'d find some new minerals there!When I got there, however, I found that the pink hue of this beach came from the countless tiny crystals there. The crystals were red, combining with the color of the sand to make the beach look pink. After observing them for a while, I found that these crystals would continuously break down into smaller crystals until they became invisible dust and were carried away by the tide. When the tide receded, because the crystals had disappeared, the beach ultimately returned to its original appearance.Umm, I\'m going a little off-topic. I mentioned this because the crystals have something to do with the person we\'re going to talk about next, which is Beryl. Those crystals were created by her.

They are a part of my body, or should I say... a part of me. My body has become a crystal. These crystals are the source of my strength, and the reason my eyes are this color. I can... control these crystals to trap and attack my enemies, and I can also cause these crystals to emerge from an enemy\'s body. But don\'t be afraid, %s—I\'d never do that to you, because... you\'re special.I hate these crystals, but I cannot be parted from them. When I think about that, I sometimes feel like I have no future. That\'s why people think I\'m so miserable all the time. If I hadn\'t met Faust and that white suitcase, I would have grown tired of this world long ago...And then, I wouldn\'t have met %s..."},{"file_name":"Her Story (II)","files":"My family... used to be nobles of Lumopolis. Now, our name has been forgotten, and all records have been erased... I can\'t even remember our surname. It may have been Gautier or something like that... Because of that incident, I left Lumopolis when I was very young, and because of these crystals on my body, my memories of the past have become vague and hazy. Sometimes, I even doubt whether I was really born in Lumopolis. The noble identity in my memory... is it real, or is it fabricated by the crystals?Whatever the case, I can\'t return to Lumopolis now. These crystals are forbidden there... It\'s just like Faust said, the Sanguine Crystal these crystals came from was being studied by my family, who were banished from Lumopolis after that incident. It seemed all I could do was follow the True Order, but fortunately, you appeared...It\'s getting late. I\'ll tell you more about that \\"incident\\" next time."},{"file_name":"Her Story (III)","files":"These crystals are not a disease, but a curse... Although this curse was inflicted on me by another, I am also partly to blame.As you know, my family once studied the sanguine crystal in great depth. However, there was another family in Lumopolis also exploring its use. To be exact, they coveted its power... They made numerous unscrupulous attempts to take it for their own.I was abducted by that family when I was young... The reason, according to them, was my great potential for Luminatics. Some say, however, that they simply wanted to take away the youngest child of the Gautier family. Regardless of the cause, the result was that they infused me with sanguine crystal powder... After that, my body became like this...So, I wonder if this curse was imposed on me, or it was the inevitable awakening of the potential coursing through my veins...?"},{"file_name":"Her Story (IV)","files":"%s, sometimes I think that, even if I manage to get rid of the crystals in my body, I... I cannot change the past, and I\'ll never live the life of peace I long for. It\'s not about the power I possess; it\'s all about the mistakes I\'ve made in the past.Please try to understand; I did make an unforgivable mistake... In the beginning, after I was taken away by that family, the sanguine crystal caused me to lose consciousness, and I became unable to control myself.I went berserk, I assume... I only vaguely remember people screaming, Eclipsites invading, houses falling, and the banner of Lumopolis... When I regained my senses, I saw my family fall in front of me. They were buried under red crystal shards, like some kind of burial mound...%s, do you think that someone like me can still have a future?"}],"story":[],"voice":["Can the way of the True Order save me?
