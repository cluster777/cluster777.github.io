Storm!","Dare you stare into this blinding light!","A new storm is arriving!","I get to do whatever I want now?","Stay away, if you want to live.","A golden storm. Isn\'t it beautiful?","The last sun will never set!","I\'m bored! Who took my guitar? Oh, he\'d better get ready to be scorched...","Need... more... power...","Alchemy! Stars!","Did you listen to Barbara\'s latest album yet? It\'s so bad it should be thrown in an incinerator. The band sounds like garbage!","You really want to chat with me? Fine. What kind of music do you like? You better think it over. I\'m not associating myself with someone who has no taste.","Curious about this power? It\'s raw power that gets out of control easily, so people keep their distance away...which suits me just fine! Hahahaha!","Born like the sun, die like the storm! Tremble before the fusing sun!","Cut to the chase. Where to go next? I can\'t wait to burn those scums to cinders!","Master the power, not be a slave to it. No matter what, I am the captain of my own fate.","That\'s an interesting bunch of clowns you got there as well. They really remind me of that clown, Sinsa.","Interesting... I can see there\'s an ever-burning fire in your eyes too. Maybe your fire is more reckless than mine...","This sunken land needs a new sun, but it won\'t be me. Maybe you can be the one...","Can I, the destroyer, also be a protector?","Time for metal! Rock on, everyone!","Don\'t disturb me when I\'m playing music!","Oh, you think you can control me?","Huh. I thought you\'re done already.","Seriously? You\'re asking me to do this?","It\'s too quiet at night. Unacceptable! Need a lil rock \'n\' roll to raise some spirits!","You\'re the one? Humph. You might show me something interesting. Don\'t disappoint me, for your sake, or else...","No use in trying to please me.","Nice. How about a VIP concert ticket for you?","Are you... my number one fan?","This gift proves that we may have a lot in common!","It will only take a second!","Burn in the blazing sun!","You sure you wanna go that far?","So what if people criticize my music? Those old farts and their rules are doomed. I\'m not gonna waste my breath on them.","I know what Sinsa is expecting of me—not just the wildfire that sets enemies ablaze, but also a guiding light. I just don\'t know, nor care, if I can live up to his expectations.","True strength is the only thing that can win the respect of the Rediesels. However, you\'ve shown me another possibility. Perhaps one day I can live up to my brother\'s expectations of me.","Sorry to keep y\'all waiting, lads!"],"skins":[],"description":"Her bold and uninhibited nature, as well as her impulsiveness, are the marks of a true rock n\' roll soul! Her fierce musical style made her exceedingly popular within Rediesel Wrench, allowing her to not only inspire troops, but also lead them in a charge.","realName":"Regina","nickname":"Solar Storm","gender":"Female","height":"5\'8\'\'","birthday":"August 1","birthplace":"Unknown","style":"Solar Storm"}')}}]);
