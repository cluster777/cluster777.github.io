Don\'t worry, I get it, we shouldn\'t flaunt wealth.I started working for the guild a long time ago. I assure you that I have a professional sales attitude, know everything you need to know about my goods, and have the best after-sales service you\'ll ever get. These goods are all great value for your money, and I\'ve collected all of them in anticipation of meeting you. I decided to follow you from the moment we met.

It turns out the Colossus isn\'t your private property. No wonder I always found you to be different from those chubby merchants... It doesn\'t matter though. Given your identity, it\'s a piece of cake to line your pockets with money. I believe you know the importance of money. You need it to buy the resources you need in life, a house to live in, the time of others, life-saving medicines, the opportunities to prolong the lives of your relatives, and even ways to stay away from wars. Gold is still very useful even in times of war. The reasons mentioned above are the values of money that I know of. It\'s something that allowed me to spend more time with my mother.If you need me to, I am more than happy to share with you ways in which you can make money from others. The first thing you need to do is to find someone that looks wealthy. It would be best if this person is a jerk.

You\'re curious about why I like money so much?Do you even have to ask? You can do so much more compared to the poor. What? Money can\'t buy true love? My naive boss, what you said has some truth in it, but you must be careful of the temptation of money. In the face of money, sincerity might not come first. Hey, why are you looking at me like that? Although I like money a lot, I can still distinguish between good and evil. This Colossus you control is always with you, right? I once had two partners who were like that, but maybe such bonds shouldn\'t exist in times of war. A money-grubber, betrayed by money itself. How ridiculous.You don\'t get it?
