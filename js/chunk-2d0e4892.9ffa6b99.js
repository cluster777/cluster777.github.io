Each class should abide by its own responsibilities; our impatience and extravagance are signs that we have gone astray.I told my father this, but he didn\'t care about whether or not I had any strange dreams or said any strange things. The only thing that was important to him was that I behave elegantly like a well-bred nobleman... I did as he wished until he died.These things are all in the past now and are no longer important.
