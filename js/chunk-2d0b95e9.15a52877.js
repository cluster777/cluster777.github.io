I would say precise excision.","I\'ll probably go back to being a doctor after the darkness in Umbraton recedes. Before that, I must perform another surgery, a surgery for Umbraton.","I once wished to save more people with my lancet. Now, I wish I could become the lancet of Umbraton and remove its necrotic parts.","Caelestite? Interesting. May I study your body? I want to know if Caelestites have the same fatal parts as normal Aurorians... Ha-ha, just kidding.","You can come to me if you need surgery. I\'ve stopped practicing medicine but my skills are more honed than before. Why? It\'s a secret.","The more patients I see, the more I realize how fragile life is. Therefore, I have a better understanding of how to cure them or send them away.","Cardiac surgery? It isn\'t that easy to bring someone back from the dead.","Saving people is not in conflict with killing people. They are just different forms of practicing one\'s belief.","Slice from the best angle... Oh, don\'t worry about it. The aorta is so fragile that you can slice it any way you like.","You look rested. Remember to wash your hands often to prevent from falling sick.","Getting up early in the morning is good for health. I assume it\'s the same for Caelestites.","It\'s dinner time. Don\'t work on an empty stomach. It can be harmful.","Are you still working? Staying up late increases the risk of dying from myocardial infarction. Get some rest now.","Why did you ask for me? I was indeed a doctor who can perform surgeries but I\'ve changed my profession... I\'m an assassin now.","Right. Thanks.","Looks nice. I\'ll take it.","Hmm? Thanks a lot.","Thank you. I\'ll cherish it.","Let the pills work their charm!","Be purged of this chronic disease!","Please relax, my patients.","Wounds left by Eclipsites are tricky to treat sometimes. It took me a lot of effort dealing with them during the days of my medical studies in Lumopolis. Fortunately, I did well on it.","I saved a lot of people with my lancet but not my parents. It didn\'t work for Eclipsites, so I used another knife.","The chronic disease of Umbraton can\'t be cured with ordinary methods. It requires a lot of removals and patching-ups while waiting for new hopes to sprout. Before then, I\'ll continue to pull my weight.","Fine, I\'ll be the main surgeon this time."],"skins":[],"description":"An assassin in Umbraton who performs \\"special\\" tasks for Istvan.
