I\'ll give her this, Allura really knows how to make an entrance. I couldn\'t help but feel on edge. Unexpectedly, she calmly took out her pocket watch, glanced at it, then told us that she had been waiting 330.6 seconds from the moment she knocked at the gate to the moment we opened it. She then proceeded to tell us that she could have completed eleven bounties and picked up eleven rewards during that time... but that she\'d forgive us if we sold this big antique to her for 11 Nightium.

Knowing about antiques is impressive, you say? I\'ve always loved looking at them, ever since I was a child. I\'d often sneak out of the house to go to antique stores and exhibitions. I thought this was just a hobby I\'d slowly developed by myself, but I later learned that my biological parents were antique collectors. They died before I could remember their faces... I don\'t even know what they looked like.But blood doesn\'t lie, does it? My gift and passion for antiques come from them, so I don\'t feel sad that they\'re gone.

I\'ve been training myself to become a mercenary over the years, and I\'ve gotten pretty good at it. No matter how difficult a quest is, as long as the pay is good, I\'ll take it on. Why did I choose to become a mercenary? I didn\'t have any other choice, %s... My adoptive mother was a mercenary. She made enough money from it to raise me. Well, that\'s one reason. The other reason... I\'ll never forget the day Eclipsites raided my hometown, Maida Mesa... They killed my mother. When I realized that I was all alone in the world, something snapped in my brain. I stood up and remembered everything my mother had taught me, accepting quests and giving them my all. But back then, I had zero skills. I was living from job to job, but somehow, I survived. Now, there\'s nothing I fear more than having no money... Don\'t get me wrong, money\'s not all I care about.

So, I quietly followed the merchant and came to Umbraton. Sure enough, the streets of Umbraton were really busy, but I couldn\'t find any of these opportunities the merchant had been talking about. Things got really bad... sometimes I had to secretly steal other people\'s food, just so I wouldn\'t starve.Things continued like that until one day, when I was desperate and trying to steal some food once again, I suddenly saw a black feather floating before my eyes, and a little girl with wings flew and landed in front of me. She said that she remembered me... and I remembered her, too—it was Eho. After my adoptive mother died, I collapsed in my house. It was Eho who woke me up with her wings. Back then, she was just an assistant, following behind her tutor. But now she has become a qualified courier.She told me that she sometimes did part-time surveillance work, and that she was on her way to monitor the area for thieves. She patted me with her wings and hurried off to work. Perhaps if Eho hadn\'t snapped me out of that rut I was in, I would\'ve ended up getting arrested for thieving... or perhaps even worse."},{"file_name":"Her Story (IV)","files":"At first, I was only offered simple requests, and that was all I could handle at the time.

After all, not only was I getting paid, I was also getting to practice my skills against the Eclipsites I ran into during my delivery requests. At first, I just wanted to take them down, but soon, it just became too easy. I started to set targets for myself, like telling myself that I had to hit a certain part of an Eclipsite to complete the challenge... Over time, the name Allura became synonymous with the word \\"sharpshooter,\\" and the requests started piling up. One day, I received a request from the Istvan Gang. The request was for me to join them. I\'d long heard that the Istvan Gang was synonymous with \\"money,\\" so naturally, there was no way I\'d pass up a chance like that. I still take on some part-time work from the Courier Union when I have time. Maybe soon, I\'ll finally have my own antique shop...All right, bring it over. Huh? The money, of course.
