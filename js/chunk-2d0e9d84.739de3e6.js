Legend has it that Windward Forest is blessed by spring air and thus enjoys a moderate climate all year round, setting it apart from the rest of Northland. My father was a forest keeper, too, when he was still alive. I\'ve been exploring the woods and practicing my swordsmanship since childhood. Life back then was simple, but also unforgettable to me...

I still remember that time, when the Eclipsites were defeated and peace returned to Northland. Father, however, came home injured and succumbed to his wounds soon after. The grief overwhelmed my mother and she fell ill as well. She passed when I was still a child. As much as she was concerned about me, she couldn\'t do anything but keep telling me to \\"take care of yourself and practice sword skills for defense...\\" But other than crying, I couldn\'t do anything back then, either.

Even though I still remembered my mother\'s dying words, every time I picked up the wooden sword I\'d recall how my father died in pain and agony. I just couldn\'t face it... so I stopped training. I didn\'t want to leave the forest after losing my parents, since it was the only family I had left. Then I met Leah. I didn\'t want to see anybody at all back then, much less complete strangers, so I evaded her... But Leah was a peculiar one, she didn\'t try to talk to me, but camped by the door and enveloped the house with her Breath of Spring. I didn\'t want to admit it then, but it was very warm and comforting... I finally couldn\'t stand it and made the first move to talk to her. My life totally changed from that day on. Without her, I don\'t think you would ever see me here."},{"file_name":"His Story (IV)","files":"Yes, Leah helped me leave the forest behind, and it wasn\'t until then that I found out my parents had asked the villagers to look after me, and that those kind people had been trying to track me down because of the promise. Out of guilt, or maybe something else, I thought I should protect the forest and the villages in my father\'s place. Thus, from that day on I began training with swords again and became stronger. As I grew, the villagers took great care of me and I\'d do my best to protect them in return. I should be satisfied with how it turned out for me, right? Yet I always felt lonely and empty. I didn\'t find comfort until Leah showed up. I\'m a little embarrassed about it, but I wanted to be closer to her so I\'d go on patrol with her every day.

I\'ll introduce you to everyone in the Windward Forest when I get the chance.","This sword? It may be made of wood, but it\'s as sharp as iron.","Please stay away from me when I\'m wielding my sword, in case you get entangled by the vines.","This kind of room\'s... a little difficult to adapt to in a short time. I\'m sorry. This is a nice room. There\'s just no aura of nature here.","It\'s the most important time of the day. Exercise regularly and don\'t slack off.","Good morning. You look... kinda tired.","Good evening. The forest can be very dangerous at night. You\'d better stay away from it.","I understand how you must be feeling, since there\'s never enough time to do everything. Still, it\'s important to get proper rest.","I am Sylva, the forest keeper of the Windward Forest. Nice to meet you.","This... Can I keep it?","Thank you...

However, he left me too soon, and my mother found it too unbearable that she... Never mind. It\'s nothing.","The premature death of my parents gave me quite a blow as I was still a kid back then. It was Leah who helped me recover from the trauma. If it wasn\'t for her, I wouldn\'t be who I am now.","I always feel kind of ashamed every time this is brought up. For a very long time, I\'d thought Leah was a boy. It always makes me feel like burying myself in the ground whenever I think back to the time I spent with her.","I\'ll do my part."],"skins":[],"description":"A forest keeper from Northland.
