I guess that\'s one of my weaknesses.I\'ve been working with her for about half a year now. One day, Lepidoz, the giant lizard of the Rediesel Wrench, suddenly broke down. Everyone in the Rediesel Wrench was bummed out about it. For a few days, they hovered around us day and night, asking when the giant lizard would be fixed... Such pestering can make a technician feel nervous.Maybe it was because of this that glasses didn\'t bother fixing it after all that time. That was when I realized—the reason Lepidoz couldn\'t get up was that there was something wrong with the balance system in its tail. I tried fixing it, and sure enough, it started moving!

However, as I wasn\'t the sharpest tool in the shed, I was sent to work in an Undercity, but I really couldn\'t get used to the flow of things there, so I left Illumina. I later discovered that the reason for this discontentment was that I just couldn\'t get used to such an anonymous existence.I spent a few months living free, doing as I pleased until I arrived in the Rediesel Desert. Maybe it was because I like helping others so much, but disputes would break out between people who have asked me for help, and one night, an all-out bar fight erupted. Just when things were looking grim, that revolver girl passed by. She\'s uncannily observant, I\'ll give her that! She deduced that I was the cause of the fight, and so she snatched me away and put me to work at the Rediesel Wrench camp. When the boss Sinsa saw the good work I was doing, he said I could stay.I soon realized that the revolver girl had done me a big favor.

See my tail? This is the legacy my ancestors left me. My unique appearance is part of the reason I have so many \\"fans\\"; it just seems to draw people in...Because of this, while I was at school in Gannon City, the other kids found it impossible to concentrate while I was in the classroom, and they even set up a special class for just me alone. Although I graduated soon after, Gannon still insisted on sending me to a remote Undercity, and my life became miserable... So I left.Fortunately, the Rediesel Wrench guys don\'t pay this anomaly any notice. But there are still a lot of people who need my help, the ones you called my \\"fans.\\" Ah...

Make sure you use them properly!","Life\'s difficulties are like stubborn screws. Sometimes you just need the right kind of screwdriver to ease them out.","I\'ve really learned a lot here. Thanks to your support, I can now upgrade my mecha gear! But I\'ll need a whole lot more metal, first...","I remember Illumina set up a special boys-only class for me. I guess they were afraid the girls were getting too distracted! Heh...","Illumina arranged for me to work in a men-only factory for a while... That was a dull period of my life!","My horns and tail always get a lot of attention... I\'m not sure why, though.","What a huge Colossus...

Hmm, I\'m not sure what I should do about it.","Do you want to see my toolbox? I call it Allen, and it\'s full of interesting tools!","There\'s so much to repair today! There\'s the daily Colossus maintenance, that stack of Rediesel Wrench requests... The list goes on and on!","Good morning! My repair work didn\'t wake you up, did it?","It\'s evening already? The day\'s almost done, and I still have a few things to repair!","These schematics are so hard to draw... It looks like I\'m going to be up all night.","You\'re the Navigator, right?

How can I ever repay you!?","Machine Overload!","Boom, baby!","You\'re up, wrench!","Lepidoz breaks down all the time... If I hadn\'t fixed her two years ago, she\'d still be sleeping in her den right now.","I wasn\'t popular with the guys in Illumina... It\'s so strange how they practically forced me out.","I guess I inherited my horns and tail from distant ancestors. My great grandfather also came out like this, and he didn\'t have many guy friends, either!","No problemo!"],"skins":[],"description":"A good-natured Rediesel Wrench technician.
