Nobody wants to smell me, so out of desperation, I made myself a biohazard suit and a gas mask to cover myself up from head to toe. Huh? The canisters on my tail? Oh, I made them, too. I was thinking I shouldn\'t waste my natural-born gifts, so I canned up the stink gas just in case I got into a fight! Anyway, I don\'t mind that much anymore.

Yeah, other people saw me as crazy, but I was doing what I liked, so I didn\'t care what they thought. People said that I don\'t look like I\'m from Umbraton, but so what?

However, even though I love it, I\'ve been feeling fatigued lately, probably because the dangerous work is getting too much for me at an older age. So, I\'m looking for a job that\'s not that perilous and still makes me money. I\'m still young, you said?
