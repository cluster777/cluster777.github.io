Are you telling me you guys were robbed by Eclipsites?"},{"char":"Kleken:","dialogue":"This isn\'t just a job, it has to do with my ideals... with the palaces of our hearts."},{"char":"Kleken:","dialogue":"But I have no way of delivering this merchandise to the Umbraton merchants anymore..."},{"char":"Kleken:","dialogue":"And they\'re going to suffer because of it, I\'m sure."},{"char":"Kleken:","dialogue":"When I think about it like that, my conscience threatens to rip me apart."},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"Quit talking about your ideals already!"},{"char":"Kleken:","dialogue":"I\'ll carry the boxes!

I finally made it..."},{"char":"Umbraton Merchant:","dialogue":"Oh! You\'re finally here! I\'ve been waiting all day!"},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"This merchandise is really important! Are you the one I\'m supposed to deliver it to?"},{"char":"Umbraton Merchant:","dialogue":"Sure I am! Hmm, not bad... Here, let me take a look at what we have today."},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"There\'s no time! We need to go back and rescue Kleken! He\'s surrounded by Eclipsites!"},{"char":"Umbraton Merchant:","dialogue":"Hah? But the shopkeeper over there got a message from Kleken not half an hour ago. He said..."},{"char":"Umbraton Merchant:","dialogue":"He said that everything has been taken care of. Just wait for the one to show up with the goods."},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"Eh? Half an hour ago?"},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"Wouldn\'t that have been right after I left?"},{"char":"Umbraton Merchant:","dialogue":"He also said he found someone really efficient to deliver the goods this time, and no need to worry. You\'re that person he mentioned, I assume?"},{"char":"Umbraton Merchant:","dialogue":"You\'re a little slow though. By our count, you should have been here ten minutes ago."},{"char":"Umbraton Merchant:","dialogue":"That guy\'s been making a fortune with this line of work. You must be well-paid since you work for him, huh?"},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"Did you say \\"making a fortune\\"?

Have you been stealing these stuff from other people to sell them to the merchants?"},{"char":"Kleken:","dialogue":"Just calm down, Navigator. This is all just a misunderstanding. Let me explain..."},{"char":"Kleken:","dialogue":"When I came here, and asked for your help..."},{"char":"Kleken:","dialogue":"It was because I had a very important job to do, namely, wiping out some Eclipsites."},{"char":"Kleken:","dialogue":"We did, in fact, run into some trouble while preparing for the Ocean Sovereignâ€”a mob of Eclipsites that had entrenched themselves here."},{"char":"Kleken:","dialogue":"Also, I really was wounded, and couldn\'t handle the heat."},{"char":"Kleken:","dialogue":"I was too weak to do the job, and you helped me finish it. I should be thanking you."},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"But when I asked if those were your guys\' merchandise, why did you..."},{"char":"Kleken:","dialogue":"I told you, it has to do with my ideals, and with the palaces of our hearts."},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"Were you dodging the question on purpose?!"},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"I thought you were trying to say that the merchandise was important to realize your dreams or something!"},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"I even thought you guys might be trying to save money to build a palace!"},{"char":"Kleken:","dialogue":"Hehe... Not bad at all, Navigator. You discovered the truth even quicker than I had anticipated."},{"char":"Kleken:","dialogue":"But if you truly think I\'m doing all this for the money, then you\'re sorely mistaken."},{"char":"Kleken:","dialogue":"I am, in fact, acting in the interest of my ideals."},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"What does that even mean?! Because I am, in fact, convinced you\'re just using me to make some money!"},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"You used me to find the Eclipsites, and you used me to deliver the merchandise..."},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"But most importantly, none of those merchandises belonged to any of you."},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"Did you ever stop to think how worried the original owners of those merchandises might be right now?"},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"Or do you think you can just pawn off whatever you steal from Eclipsites?"},{"char":"Kleken:","dialogue":"That\'s enough. According to the Istvan Gang\'s investigation on the goods, we came to the conclusion..."},{"char":"Kleken:","dialogue":"That the merchandise has no original owner."},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"So what, you\'re trying to say this wasn\'t a dirty deal, to begin with?"},{"char":"Kleken:","dialogue":"Correct. This is a very important piece of information, without it, you would definitely misunderstand my intentions."},{"char":"Kleken:","dialogue":"When I get my payment, it is just for eliminating Eclipsites and nothing else."},{"char":"Kleken:","dialogue":"The rest of it goes straight to the Istvan Gang."},{"char":"Kleken:","dialogue":"You may not know it, but the Shadowlord is quite fond of performing \\"good deeds.\\""},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"Okay..."},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"Sorry, I admit I misunderstood you a bit just now."},{"char":"Kleken:","dialogue":"Don\'t mention it."},{"char":"Kleken:","dialogue":"As a scam artist, I prefer being mistrusted to being trusted."},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"Why do I get the feeling you\'re being sarcastic..."},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"So what\'s this \\"ideal\\" you keep talking about? You said you were acting in the interests of your ideals, right?"},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"After hearing that you were selling that stuff to the merchant, I thought you were doing it for the money..."},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"But using dirty money... to build a palace? In any case, at least now I know that the money isn\'t dirty."},{"char":"Kleken:","dialogue":"The festival."},{"char":"Kleken:","dialogue":"The Ocean Sovereign is still a festival, after all."},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"Uh... I\'m well aware that it\'s a festival. What kind of answer is that?"},{"char":"Kleken:","dialogue":"Let\'s not be hasty.
