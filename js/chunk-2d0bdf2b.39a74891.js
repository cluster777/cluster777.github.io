When I first met her, I was instantly attracted by her lovely partial wing.She would describe her Lumopolis sermons to us when she was on the Expedition Team. She was a little uncomfortable at first, folding her wing close to her, even losing a few feathers. Later, she strived to learn and get accustomed to doing the tasks until she could face them calmly and efficiently. Maybe that\'s why she came off more mature than her peers. Before she joined, I had reservations on whether the \\"Angel from Lumopolis\\" could work with everyone. But then I discovered she would listen to discussions patiently and make analyses and conclusions. She also is efficient, responsible, and a remarkable fighter.

It represents Lord Irridon\'s recognition of me, while the position of Academy Advocate enables me to promote Lumopolis. After all, we are the heirs and propagators of civilization.You must know that there will always be difficulties and obstacles in any new role, which is also the case in the operation team.

I cherish them and am grateful to them for bringing me closer to the right path. I will use them to prove to the whole world that Lumopolis loves and guides all living beings.I believe that everyone is born with their own mission, and it is my mission to have these pure wings and prove the value of their existence, even though my two wings had become one. It was damage caused by the Eclipsites and is a mark of my battles against evil.

This is very important because suffering and poverty are difficult to stamp out. The most important thing is to give people faith and reverence so that they may live better lives. I don\'t care what people say about me since they can only see what\'s on the surface. I decided my own path in life a long time ago, and will lead the way so that glory and guidance fall on every believer fairly.
