It would be perfect if there is a slight breeze.","There are too many noisy paramecia on this continent.","It\'s such a big fellow, but it\'s so quiet when it flies. It is indeed a creation from ancient civilization.","Do you want to see the real catacomb, simpleton?","Can\'t you perform your duties properly, simpleton? Fine, I\'ll help you.","I\'ll hold them off.","Is that the best you can do?","The breath of death.","Goodbye, paramecia.","Show yourself.","Happy New Year.","All I need is myself.","Faria is awoken.","I have secured the power of the Catacomb.","Maybe... I\'ll be able to break free from the crypt.","Have you got nothing to do, simpleton? Wanna swap places? Come sit here.","This is my true power.","Alchemy Stars.","I stayed here only because I want to. It has nothing to do with you, simpleton.","You\'re a simpleton, but you\'re different from those paramecia. That\'s probably why you can pilot the Colossus.","Sometimes it serves no purpose to try to talk sense into those blockheads. Just give them orders.","I\'ll never need the help of those paramecia no matter how difficult it gets.","Can you smell the danger now? You\'ll have to be careful when you approach me from now on.","Are you surprised, simpleton? This is my real power, but I don\'t care about it at all.","The Tantus family has been responsible for guarding the Starry Crypt since ancient times. I have no choice but to inherit the mission.","My power comes from my family, but what I am experiencing now... will become a valuable strength that belongs only to me.","Many say that I married the Catacomb, but one day I will leave it with my own strength after my mission is completed.","So what if they knew about my past? All they can do is sigh.","I hope you won\'t always ask questions like those blockheads.","Please don\'t put me with anyone. I like peace and quiet... Though I didn\'t say you should leave.","Stop greeting me all the time. Go do what you should do, simpleton.","It\'s always so quiet in the morning, but it\'ll become really noisy once those blockheads wake up.","Enjoy the dazzling noon sunlight by yourself, simpleton. I\'m going to rest now.","I want to enjoy this peaceful night, simpleton. Don\'t let any paramecia bother me.","I am Sikare, Keeper of the Crypt. Why do you look shocked? I hope the title didn\'t frighten you.","This doesn\'t catch my eye, simpleton.","The Tantus family will remember your gift, simpleton.","Mmm, this is more like it.","You... Thank you.","Faria, open!","Faria, release!","Faria, be prepared.","The Tantus family is not a subordinate of the True Order. Instead, they are allies. You must be able to tell the difference.","Faria... It\'s the key to the Starry Crypt, and the Grave Keeper is the only one who can control it. You don\'t need to know much about this. I\'ll explain to you when I think it\'s necessary.","Since I was born, my mission has been to guard this catacomb until I die, or... am reborn.","I\'m not used to operating with others."],"skins":[],"description":"A True Order member.
