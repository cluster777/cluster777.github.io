I challenged her for her position. She accepted my challenges and also gave me a lot of resources.I actually didn\'t covet the position of the Grand Marshal of the Illumina. I was just haunted by the anxious feeling that I would never catch up to Reinhardt. That\'s why I can never relax and always look for reasons to challenge her. Certainly, the reason I could do that was that I had enough strength.

I didn\'t disappoint the people who believed in me as I made great achievements in several wars. If I hadn\'t missed out on several major battles because I was unconscious for those three years, I might even have been promoted faster...After I regained consciousness, relying on my own strength and Reinhardt\'s assistance, I was quickly promoted to be the Guard Captain even though several other Legion Commanders questioned me and even suspected that I would betray the Illumina... What a joke! I\'ve always been upright and have always let my strength do the talking. I would never resort to such underhanded tactics! Even if I were to betray the Illumina, I would do it frankly and straightforwardly!You didn\'t see the faces of those who questioned me when I commanded the soldiers of the other Legions to attack the wandering Eclipsites. Their eyes were bulging from shock! I still feel proud when I recall those times."},{"file_name":"Her Story (IV)","files":"At that time, I had just graduated and had no war experience. Although I was young and rash, I still had some doubts about myself. Perhaps that was why I had some wild thoughts and hesitated when I was going to volunteer to fight when Undercity requested assistance... As a result, Reinhardt beat me to it and became a leader with great achievements.I hated myself for hesitating. My natural pride wouldn\'t let me bow down to others. From then on, my biggest goal was to surpass Reinhardt. I trained harder and harder to become stronger. Until I was badly wounded one day... The last thing I saw before falling into a coma was Reinhardt swinging her sword in front of me. She saved me, and I am grateful to her for that, but I also hate her for it! My pride was completely shattered in front of her. Since then, I started to worry that I would never surpass her, and yet there was nothing I could do other than trying to become even stronger.Pressure? Of course, I have pressure. I usually rely on meditation and fighting to release my stress... I\'m sure you are under a lot of pressure since you control this Colossus.
