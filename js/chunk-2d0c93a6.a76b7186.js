She neither resisted nor accepted her family education. Instead, she cleverly acted like the lady of a noble family in front of outsiders while secretly doing the things she liked. Fortunately, she had an extraordinary talent for martial arts and magic.

That being said, she always appears calm and efficient when she is on the hunt for Eclipsites.
