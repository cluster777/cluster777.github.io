The situation was quite urgent at that time and it was not the time to sleep, but I was just too sleepy!You want to know about my dreams? They were all about weird stuff, but I can tell you if you really want to know. I think it was something that happened a long time ago. In the dream, I wore an exquisite dress and gorgeous jewelry and was sitting on some tall steps... I waited as some pious people prayed to me. They placed their heads on my knees while muttering to themselves... When night fell, I would kneel and pray for everyone in the village. I would pray for the end of the war, for the safety of our warriors, and for the flames of war to spare the village... But it seemed like my efforts were futile as the village finally fell into ruin because of the war. In the dream, I eventually stopped my futile prayers and turned to the Eclipsites...Huh? What happened next? After that... *Yawns* I\'ve said enough today. I\'ll tell you more next time."},{"file_name":"Her Story (III)","files":"Huh? You want to touch Philyshy\'s cat ears? I guess that\'s okay. I love cats because they\'re soft and warm, just like Yumi!Yumi used to be my pet cat. She was very cute and was my only friend in my childhood! But she fell ill and died later on. I can\'t remember what happened back then, except that I was so sad that I kept crying, refusing to eat or drink anything.Although I had opportunities to pick another cat as my pet later on, just the thought of experiencing all that pain again put me off the idea... If possible, I hope I wound never suffer from that again in my life. After all, I prefer living a relaxed life!But Yumi has returned to me now. Although she is quite fierce, she\'s also a good kid... I\'ll cherish every day we spend together this time."},{"file_name":"Her Story (IV)","files":"What happened? Why are you so surprised? Of course I\'m not Philyshy. I\'m Yumi—don\'t forget my name, meow! Philyshy is asleep right now, so don\'t disturb her unless you have something important to tell her. I won\'t speak nicely or gently like her, meow!Oh? You\'re curious about who I am? Hmm, you sure ask a lot of questions... but Philyshy wants me to be nicer to you... Argh! I\'m not going to tell you who I am! I\'ll be nicer to you, but that doesn\'t mean I have to answer your questions.Even though Philyshy doesn\'t want to admit it, I am here because she wants me to. As long as she still needs me, I\'ll continue to protect her, love her, and do everything she wants me to do... I\'ll always be here with her. Philyshy is the most important person to me, and I don\'t care what she thinks of me. If Philyshy wants me to disappear one day, I\'ll fall into an eternal slumber inside her...H-hey! Don\'t look at me like that! You\'re dead meat if you tell her what I just said! I\'ll also make you pay for it if you try to bully her!"}],"story":[],"voice":["Everyone at Illumina is way too serious about work, meow.
