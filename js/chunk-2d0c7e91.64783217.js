I am already prepared for that."},{"file_name":"Her Story (III)","files":"I hope you don\'t mind if I tell you a story about another family on Cloud Mountain in the Far East—a story about the Sakae Family and my master, Sakae Shigeo, who was the last sword soul master of the Sakae Family. The Eclipsites attacked us at the place where we were temporarily staying. My master and I did our best to cover the retreat of the nearby residents, but my master was dealt a serious wound that he could not recover from. He entrusted me with his power and mission, leaving me this Sakae blade... I don\'t think it\'s a simple matter to accept all facts and beliefs. As the last soul of the Sakae Family, he faced everything with patience, integrity, and calmness. He sacrificed in a fire. He entrusted everything of the Sakae family to me, and I have engraved this in my heart so that I\'ll never forget.From my point of view, my master has just left for the opposite shore before me. His destination is where we will all end up when our lives eventually end.However... rather than getting entangled with the future, I rather make my current wishes come true."},{"file_name":"Her Story (IV)","files":"During our constant travels on the Colossus, I am sometimes reminded of some stories of the past. This story took place in a land far away and is about the Sakura Family that no longer exists.The members of this family were bathed in sakura blossoms when they were born and had a short and limited time in this world. To maximize the value of their lives, they constantly sought to burn up their lives for a moment of splendor and beauty. After that, they would wait for their lives to end without any regrets. This belief was nurtured in their bloodline, yet it was this belief that almost ended their bloodline. They were supposed to wither overnight like the sakura blossoms they admired, but they probably didn\'t expect there to be one flower that didn\'t want to leave its branch, or that this flower would leave behind a lonely seed... I never met my parents and don\'t know why my mother left me at the door of the Sakae Family famed for its kendo prowess.Later, I took the initiative to join Illumina... As my name suggests, I hope that my short life will shine with a brilliance that does my name justice."}],"story":[],"voice":["We are grateful to Illumina.
