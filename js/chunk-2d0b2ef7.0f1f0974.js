Does it mean I\'m getting an interrogation room at the Colossus?","Screams and blood...","Look right into the fear within!","The Hollow Gaze is watching you.","Experience the Abyss!","I\'m losing my reasons. I can feel it.","Ha... That\'s it?","Alchemy Stars.","Look at this cute hourglass. I made it myself. What do you think?... I can do more than interrogating prisoners. Is that so surprising?","You wanna see the eye underneath the eye patch? Nobody ever requested that before... Are you serious?","You should know I\'m skilled in making people cry. Of course, I mean when I\'m executing people. What else could it be?","People often tell me I have a twisted sense of right and wrong. What\'s right then? Is it really that important to draw a line between good and evil? Can\'t I just do what makes me happy?","I\'d thought the Colossus was an interesting place. Seems like it\'s a bit boring here. Have you got anyone that needs to be executed?","My Right Pupil can show you hell. I can also do that with my Taijutsu.","Oh... You don\'t seem to know how dangerous I am, approaching me like this...","I do love torturing people, but don\'t worry... With you, I\'ll be very gentle, for now.","Since you\'re so curious... I\'ll just show you my staff... But be careful not to touch it. You\'re the only one whom I don\'t want to see cursed.","You know what it is I want to ask... Is Victoria here?","Yes, I like blood a lot, but that doesn\'t mean I don\'t need my room to be clean and tidy.","I wonder what sounds you\'ll make in the interrogation room. But I shouldn\'t, right?","You\'re back... Huh? You want to know what I plan to do next? I have more work waiting for me in the interrogation room, of course.","How wonderful it is... to hear such beautiful screams from the interrogation room first thing in the morning.","Although I want to keep working, Victoria said it\'s important to get enough rest.","Late-night interrogations always come with surprising discoveries... Huh? You\'re up, too?","How troublesome... I\'m Eicy. Usually, I tell people my name only during interrogations. But, Victoria told me that introducing oneself is a common courtesy...","You don\'t seem to know me very well.","I didn\'t expect you to think of this. I\'m surprised...","How did you know I like this...","I never thought anyone besides Victoria would understand me so well!","Look right into the Calamity!","No one\'s getting away!","Start the interrogation now?","I come from a cursed bloodline... Anyone who makes direct eye contact with the Hollow Gaze sinks into fear and madness. My parents were no different, and lost their lives because of it.","Victoria made this eyepatch for me. It\'s an item used to inhibit the cursed power of the Hollow Gaze... You didn\'t know about it, did you?","I don\'t mind having this power. Nor do I mind being the interrogator and the executor. After all, blood and groans fulfill me...","You want me to lead? They\'ll be screwed."],"skins":[{"name":"Onyx Iris","description":"A devilish swimsuit that won over Eicy with its charm the moment she saw it. The metal chain, the heart-shaped eye mask, the black and gold circlet... The overall design radiates delicate detail and luxury. However, the dark lace hem and complex cross braided design make its overall shape all the more playful. The interlacing braids reflect Eicy\'s own interweaving with the void... but for some reason, whenever Eicy wears this swimsuit, one can also hear the faint sound of a cat\'s meow."}],"description":"An interrogator from the True Order and ardent follower of Victoria, with pupils suppressed due to their \\"Power of Doom\\".","realName":"Eicy","nickname":"Hollow Gaze","gender":"Female","height":"5\'0\\"","birthday":"September 9","birthplace":"Vortex","style":"Hollow Gaze"}')}}]);
