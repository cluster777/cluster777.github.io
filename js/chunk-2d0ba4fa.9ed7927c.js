The least you can do is look at me!"},{"char":"Illumina Soldier A:","dialogue":"I never asked you to rescue me, you hear?

Is that all you have to say?!"},{"char":"Illumina Soldier A:","dialogue":"Tsk... I know you and the Grand Marshal are close."},{"char":"Illumina Soldier A:","dialogue":"So close, in fact, that it doesn\'t matter to you if your name gets slandered. Is that it?"},{"char":"Illumina Soldier A:","dialogue":"You consider this a slander?"},{"char":"Hiiro:","dialogue":"Well... There\'s no doubt that some of it is true!"},{"char":"Illumina Soldier A:","dialogue":"But even so, I submitted evidence to refute their false claims."},{"char":"Illumina Soldier A:","dialogue":"Plenty of people came forward to testify in your defense, too."},{"char":"Illumina Soldier A:","dialogue":"And...

What kind of reply is that?!"},{"char":"Illumina Soldier A:","dialogue":"Is that all you have to say to someone who just saved your whole career?!"},{"char":"Illumina Soldier A:","dialogue":"Or are you trying to tell me that you don\'t care if I help you or not?!"},{"char":"Illumina Soldier A:","dialogue":"Hmm."},{"char":"Hiiro:","dialogue":"Y-You...!!!"},{"char":"Illumina Soldier A:","dialogue":"Thank you for submitting evidence for my sake."},{"char":"Hiiro:","dialogue":"Even if there is some truth to the accusations..."},{"char":"Hiiro:","dialogue":"I-I wasn\'t doing it for you...
