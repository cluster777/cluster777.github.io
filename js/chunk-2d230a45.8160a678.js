Curo?"},{"char":"Curo:","dialogue":"Are you trying to fish a confession out of the Navigator?"},{"char":"Benny:","dialogue":"Shut up, I wasn\'t talking to you. She gave you this before the match so you would say I lost!"},{"char":"Benny:","dialogue":"Let me guess. You saw there was no way I was going to lose, so you had no choice but to end it early and call it a draw!"},{"char":"Benny:","dialogue":"And that\'s that. Case closed, Curo. The Navigator has confessed it all."},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"Hey! I haven\'t said anything!"},{"char":"Benny:","dialogue":"Your feeble psychological defenses have crumbled! I can smell your guilt and your fear..."},{"char":"Curo:","dialogue":"Pff."},{"char":"Benny:","dialogue":"What are you laughing at?

In case of an emergency."},{"char":"Benny:","dialogue":"That phrase \\"In case of emergency\\" just reeks of weakness... I suppose you put that there for Curo?"},{"char":"Benny:","dialogue":"Aren\'t you kind?

I\'ll make sure no one shoots our precious endangered animal."},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"Perhaps that was not the best use of Zoya\'s talents, but she was there to save me."},{"char":"Benny:","dialogue":"..."},{"char":"Curo:","dialogue":"You were smart to be afraid."},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"Of course! It\'s a standard precaution.

I wouldn\'t keep working with her if she wasn\'t good for something."},{"char":"Curo:","dialogue":"No, you\'re just looking for a chance to prove you\'ve got more muscles than me."},{"char":"Benny:","dialogue":"Am I wrong? And besides, I don\'t have to prove it! I know I\'m stronger than you!"},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"Enough!!! Let me finish!"},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"There\'s no definite standard for strength. Do you think Aurorians are strong?
