The sun had already set at that time, and I was too tired to walk any further, so we decided to stay the night at that strange ruins. I suddenly woke up at midnight and saw a statue glowing in the ruins... Somehow, I ended up kneeling in front of her and making a wish... I prayed for the war to end sooner and for the power to protect myself and my family.The gods granted my wish. Hunting Stone started following me from the very next day. It was virtually indestructible and was so powerful that it could break almost anything. I was elated at first until I realized I couldn\'t get rid of it! I mean, even if I put it down only to rest alone for a moment, it will immediately come up to me! What\'s more, it\'s so big and conspicuous...

I doubted whether she really was Ms. Victoria and asked her a few questions, but then the strange person next to her started arguing with me! In any case, my actions were, to some extent, in pursuit of the Truth, right? There\'s no way I would admit that I made any mistake!Now that I think about it, the beliefs of the True Order all seem to be based on the Black Tome that Ms. Victoria believes in. They say that it\'s a holy book of prophecies. I have my doubts about it, but Ms. Victoria said that even my doubts were a part of its prophecies. She told me to wait until the Truth became reality...It\'s been a while since I joined the True Order. While I\'ve already gotten used to Hunting Stone, if possible, I still want to believe in Ms. Victoria\'s words... as long as I keep waiting, I\'ll be able to get rid of Hunting Stone one day!"}],"story":[],"voice":["Since I\'ve decided to join, I must stick to it to the end. Don\'t worry, I\'ll save you on behalf of the Truth.","Then let\'s head for the Cloudward, one step at a time. It\'s not rocket science...","I think it should be \\"Let the Truth bless you\\"!","Wow, simply unbelievable... Are we going to let anyone take lives so casually?","By the decree of the Supreme Being, I\'m here to... What? You don\'t even know who that is?","Don\'t have to be fancy. My off-hand comments alone turned the guy\'s smile into a stressed one.","Perseverance... Wait, what does \\"like\\" mean? Stuffs? Hobbies? Beliefs?","Not only far from good-looking, but undisciplined, aimless and unmotivated as well... How can I stand someone like that?","Of course I know what Colossus is! It means you\'re a special fella, does it not?","You want to chat? Sure, if you promise not to get angry, no matter what I say.","You better not run before me or I\'ll chase after you out of instinct. Yeah, just don\'t turn your back on me... Don\'t keep your eyes on me, but don\'t look away, either!","Catch up to them and never let go...","Those who violate The Law shall be punished!","Halt!","We\'ll see about that!","I never claimed to be ready!","Come, say it with me now, \\"Happy New Year\\"!","Why do you want me here?","One day I\'ll get rid of the Hunting Stone... One day!","The Law equals the Truth, understand?!","Nothing is too big to get lost in.","Either you come with me or I\'ll take you. Your pick, or I can make the choice for you... I\'ll take the silence as a \\"Yes\\"!","Done. Next.","Alchemy Stars!","The Law is the principle that governs everything in the universe, so is it that hard to fathom why I enforce it? It\'s simple, really, because therein lies the purpose of our wisdom.","The intent of a rebuttal is to point out the errors of the ways of others. It\'s a superior quality that must be implemented physically on occasion, such as reforming certain unrepentant individuals!","The digit \\"1\\", you said? No, no, I meant the word \\"one\\". What\'s the difference between them? Don\'t tell me you don\'t know the difference between numerals and alphabets.","Technically, Hunting Stone is not a wheel but a relic in certain ruins... But it\'s still obviously a wheel!","The Law is the beacon that guides you in darkness. Starting now, do some soul-searching and ponder over what kind of existence you want to become!","The descending star, the nameless relics of the past, the wheel of thorns called \\"Hunting Stone\\"... Pursue me with persistence as decreed by the Law.","Put things back where they belong, according to size and in alphabetical order... It\'s okay, I already did that for you.","No way. Why should I go with you just because you said so? Now I\'ll come with you when you don\'t want me to! Got it?!","It wasn\'t easy tracking you down. Now I need to figure out what to do with you... And I\'ll take my time for as long as I stay!","You don\'t think this is awful? Am I the only one who finds this totally meaningless?","Why don\'t I give up? Because I never give up. Tell me, can it be any other reason?","Know what\'s right from wrong, stay down to earth, with an eye to the future!","Shouldn\'t we do something since you\'re back? I mean, what else are you doing here?","You must have a schedule all fleshed out! ...no way, you don\'t?","I\'m even more stubborn than you imagined. Just wait till you want to run from me one day when you see me.","You should follow your schedule to a T, like, see, you should be taking a break right now... No? That\'s not it?","I\'m supposed to give you my name just because you asked? Aren\'t you afraid I\'d lie? What if I don\'t want to tell you? Oh, you\'re not interested now? Well, call me \'Pact\', then.","Nothing too small or too big.","Too...you can\'t take back a gift, anyway...","If I was to show that I like it, wouldn\'t that, you know...","Yeah, I do like it. What\'s it to you?","Constraint? No, it\'s persistence!","Follow The Law and never waver!","Notify you? No way!","Virtually indestructible, persistent regeneration, keeps returning regardless of where it\'s dumped... This is one tenacious Hunting Stone!","Believe in the simple Law, rely on and maintaining order, adhere to your inner resolve, being firm and solemn, that is the first step to the great Truth!","For what does one live and fight for? I had my answer one night when I raised my head and saw the stars lighting up the darkness.","Listen, don\'t ever break The Law."],"skins":[],"description":"An honest and inflexible member of the True Order.
