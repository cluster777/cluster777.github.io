What I mean is, can you try not to touch the mirror or the petals?","Once upon a time, the White Narcissus always stared at Lake Mirror... Well, where was the other flower? What flower was it?","The flower of the Northland and the mirror, two reconnected worlds—which side is real?","The White Narcissus is in full bloom again. We are twin mirror images, and we will live on from the ancient fable and continue our story.","If it doesn\'t happen naturally, then it\'ll become a struggle for us both. Is that what you\'re wishing for?","You may gain slight favor from me, but nothing else, are you satisfied with that?","If we manage to find ourselves again one day... my only hope is that you\'ll also be in my new memories.","Keep your distance and watch what you say and do. If you do that, my sister will be slightly more accepting of you.","Don\'t tell me you need me to praise you?... Let me think about it.","I feel a little uneasy... like a small stone falling into a lake.","Hmm? Have you any business related to me?","Ah! I see, your strength …you\'re an early riser.","I heard the sound of you returning, so it doesn\'t need to be made such a big deal out of. That\'s all.","It\'s quite obvious that you\'ve disturbed me... So, rest earlier.","Don\'t behave rudely, and don\'t complain that Nikinis didn\'t remind you. Geez, everything outside the Northland is so barbaric.","I shouldn\'t have expected anything from you... Hmph.","It is an expected gift, so I didn\'t look forward to it.","It\'s actually pretty good? I\'ll take it.","This... It\'s quite good this time. Well, thank you then, I guess.","Wither and bloom—","These are the spring blossoms of heaven—","I don\'t need you to remind me.","I lost my memory and any sense of nostalgia at the same time. From then on, I care not for the world outside.","Time will not rewind the fallen flowers nor my love.","The Northland guards the secret of the world. The sealed memories of the White Narcissus will be the last warning to the continent.","To say it once, and only once, that\'s how we do in Northland."],"skins":[],"description":"A beautiful and prideful girl from the Lake Mirror in Northland.
