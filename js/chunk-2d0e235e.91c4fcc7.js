Where did these puppies come from?"},{"char":"Barton:","dialogue":"...They\'re not puppies. I trained these white wolves myself."},{"char":"Vivian:","dialogue":"Oh? I didn\'t know you had pets. How adorable!"},{"char":"Barton:","dialogue":"Alright, enough... I came to ask, has the Grand Marshal responded to my request from before?"},{"char":"Vivian:","dialogue":"You mean your request to establish a navy?"},{"char":"Barton:","dialogue":"Yes. I recently came across a book on naval superiority."},{"char":"Barton:","dialogue":"I realized that Illumina\'s forces are all on land, and lacks variety."},{"char":"Barton:","dialogue":"To expand our power, we must first conquer the high seas!"},{"char":"Barton:","dialogue":"The only thing Illumina lacks right now is a proper navy!"},{"char":"Vivian:","dialogue":"Then this will come as a pleasant surprise. I was just on my way to tell you that the Grand Marshal is thrilled by your idea."},{"char":"Vivian:","dialogue":"She has already given the orders to grant you full authority to establish and to name you as its commander."},{"char":"Barton:","dialogue":"The Grand Marshal made the right decision. I swear I won\'t let anyone down. We\'ll have the most powerful navy the world has ever known!"},{"char":"Vivian:","dialogue":"Illumina only possesses a single vessel at the moment... I hope you\'ll make good use of it."},{"char":"Barton:","dialogue":"Hahahaha! That\'s more than enough!"},{"char":"Barton:","dialogue":"The sea is nothing more than a big puddle sitting on the land."},{"char":"Barton:","dialogue":"With me in charge, the ocean will belong to Illumina in no time!"},{"char":"Vivian:","dialogue":"Then we shall await good news from you, Commander Barton."},{"char":"Hvit/Ulv:","dialogue":"Oowoooooo!"},{"char":"Barton:","dialogue":"So this is the sea..."},{"char":"Illumina Soldier:","dialogue":"Commander, are we really sailing into that...?"},{"char":"Barton:","dialogue":"What\'s that supposed to mean? Are you telling me that the brave men and women of Illumina\'s grand navy are scared of the ocean?!"},{"char":"Barton:","dialogue":"You are proud soldiers of Illumina! And you WILL overcome your fears!"},{"char":"Barton:","dialogue":"On my order, board the ship and set sail!"},{"char":"Illumina Soldier:","dialogue":"Yes, sir!"},{"char":"Barton\'s Diary:","dialogue":"They say those sailors generally keep a journal of their travels, so let this serve as a record of my Conquest of the Sea!"},{"char":"Barton\'s Diary:","dialogue":"Today, we officially embarked on our journey. Just before we set sail, a soldier asked me if we were really going out to sea."},{"char":"Barton\'s Diary:","dialogue":"Did he notice it, too? For a second- no, less than a second... Even I might have wavered..."},{"char":"Barton\'s Diary:","dialogue":"Seeing the ocean with my own eyes for the first time... It was a bit different from what I had imagined."},{"char":"Barton\'s Diary:","dialogue":"Unfathomably deep and stretching into the horizon with no end in sight... It felt as though I was being crushed..."},{"char":"Barton\'s Diary:","dialogue":"But this could never stop me. No matter how vast it may be, every drop of it will be under my control!"},{"char":"Whoosh... Splash, splash... Whoosh...","dialogue":"Urgh..."},{"char":"Barton:","dialogue":"Commander... I don\'t think pacing like this will help with your seasickness..."},{"char":"Illumina Soldier:","dialogue":"Don\'t worry about that... Tell me what happened here?!"},{"char":"Barton:","dialogue":"Yes, sir! The hull suddenly took on water, Commander. The situation is dire!"},{"char":"Illumina Soldier:","dialogue":"Of all the rotten luck, and now of all times... How are repairs coming along?"},{"char":"Barton:","dialogue":"All hands on deck are working nonstop to repair the hull, sir. However..."},{"char":"Illumina Soldier:","dialogue":"Spit it out already, soldier! There\'s no time to lose!"},{"char":"Barton:","dialogue":"The storm has been impeding our progress. At this rate, it\'s only a matter of time before the entire ship sinks..."},{"char":"Illumina Soldier:","dialogue":"Unbelievable..."},{"char":"Barton:","dialogue":"R-Rest assured, Commander! None of us have any intention of abandoning ship! We\'re with you till the end!"},{"char":"Illumina Soldier:","dialogue":"No, what I mean is..."},{"char":"Barton:","dialogue":"That our first expedition into the sea should have to end like this... It\'s unbelievable! Absolutely unreasonable!"},{"char":"Barton:","dialogue":"If we want to preserve any hope of victory, we have no choice... but to abandon ship!"},{"char":"Barton:","dialogue":"Listen up, soldiers! Make for the lifeboats, and abandon ship!"},{"char":"Barton:","dialogue":"Yes, sir!"},{"char":"Illumina Soldier:","dialogue":"Urgh..."},{"char":"Barton:","dialogue":"This is the last lifeboat, Commander. Please climb aboard."},{"char":"Illumina Soldier:","dialogue":"Huh? There\'s only one spot left...?"},{"char":"Barton:","dialogue":"What about you, soldier?"},{"char":"Barton:","dialogue":"I\'m staying with the ship, sir!"},{"char":"Illumina Soldier:","dialogue":"That\'s not for you to decide!"},{"char":"Barton:","dialogue":"But sir..."},{"char":"Illumina Soldier:","dialogue":"Nonsense! You need to make your way back to the Grand Marshal, and tell her... Tell her that our first expedition out to sea was a failure!"},{"char":"Barton:","dialogue":"Y-Yes, sir!"},{"char":"Illumina Soldier:","dialogue":"Awoo!"},{"char":"Hvit/Ulv:","dialogue":"Damn... I can\'t believe I forgot about you two..."},{"char":"Barton:","dialogue":"This ship is going down any second now... And us, along with it..."},{"char":"Barton:","dialogue":"Here, grab onto this piece of wood... Don\'t let go, no matter what..."},{"char":"Barton:","dialogue":"Awoo..."},{"char":"Hvit/Ulv:","dialogue":"We sailed into a storm a few days ago. The ship took on water, and not long afterward... It sank to the bottom of the sea."},{"char":"Barton\'s Diary:","dialogue":"I ordered the crew to escape on the lifeboats. I can only hope that they made it to shore, safe and sound..."},{"char":"Barton\'s Diary:","dialogue":"Escape\' is the one word that I cannot stand. But on that day, I had no choice but to surrender."},{"char":"Barton\'s Diary:","dialogue":"Surrender... A word that has never appeared in my vocabulary, not even once."},{"char":"Barton\'s Diary:","dialogue":"But in the end, we failed to conquer the seas. Instead, the sea overwhelmed us..."},{"char":"Barton\'s Diary:","dialogue":"Oowooooooooo!"},{"char":"Hvit/Ulv:","dialogue":"Hvit... Ulv... We\'re safe for now..."},{"char":"Barton:","dialogue":"It may be an abandoned island with no means of travel or communication..."},{"char":"Barton:","dialogue":"But at least there are plenty of supplies to keep us alive for a while."},{"char":"Barton:","dialogue":"Oowoo!"},{"char":"Hvit/Ulv:","dialogue":"The sea... I never imagined it to be so dangerous or merciless..."},{"char":"Barton:","dialogue":"It reminds me..."},{"char":"Barton:","dialogue":"Of a gigantic Eclipsite, with an abyssal maw that can devour anything and everything in sight..."},{"char":"Barton:","dialogue":"No... The sea is far more terrifying than any Eclipsite..."},{"char":"Barton:","dialogue":"Far more terrifying..."},{"char":"Barton:","dialogue":"Awoo! Awoo!"},{"char":"Hvit/Ulv:","dialogue":"Hvit, Ulv... I was entirely too naive when we first set off to explore the sea."},{"char":"Barton:","dialogue":"I couldn\'t establish a navy in Illumina\'s name... I couldn\'t even keep our one and only ship from sinking..."},{"char":"Barton:","dialogue":"I failed to keep my promise. What kind of commander am I? Or soldier, for that matter...?"},{"char":"Barton:","dialogue":"Awoooo! Awoooo!"},{"char":"Hvit/Ulv:","dialogue":"You want to train now, of all times? Forget it, just go play..."},{"char":"Barton:","dialogue":"Awooooooo!"},{"char":"Hvit/Ulv:","dialogue":"Stop tugging me! I need to be alone for a while..."},{"char":"Barton:","dialogue":"Awoo..."},{"char":"Hvit/Ulv:","dialogue":"Hmm? What are you two doing with that piece of wood?"},{"char":"Barton:","dialogue":"Careful! Don\'t go into the water!"},{"char":"Barton:","dialogue":"Ooowooooooooo!"},{"char":"Hvit/Ulv:","dialogue":"Huh... Are Hvit and Ulv... surfing?!"},{"char":"Barton:","dialogue":"When did they learn to do that?"},{"char":"Barton:","dialogue":"And it looks like... they\'re having fun!"},{"char":"Barton:","dialogue":"Oowoo! Oowoo!"},{"char":"Hvit/Ulv:","dialogue":"No, I can\'t surf. You two have fun."},{"char":"Barton:","dialogue":"Oowoo! Oowoo! Oowoooooo!"},{"char":"Hvit/Ulv:","dialogue":"Fine, fine. I\'ll give it a try... Just once."},{"char":"Barton:","dialogue":"Oowoooooo!"},{"char":"Hvit/Ulv:","dialogue":"First climb onto the board, and a few strokes, then wait for the wave..."},{"char":"Barton:","dialogue":"Ah! Cough, cough... The water..."},{"char":"Barton:","dialogue":"Not good enough! Again!"},{"char":"Barton:","dialogue":"Wait for the wave, then stand up..."},{"char":"Barton:","dialogue":"Hey! I did it! I did it!"},{"char":"Barton:","dialogue":"Ah...!"},{"char":"Barton:","dialogue":"Cough, cough... And I fell again..."},{"char":"Barton:","dialogue":"Awooooooo!"},{"char":"Hvit/Ulv:","dialogue":"Hahaha! Don\'t laugh at me, you two! You don\'t get it right every time, either!"},{"char":"Barton:","dialogue":"Hmm? Am I... having fun?"},{"char":"Barton:","dialogue":"Awoooooo!"},{"char":"Hvit/Ulv:","dialogue":"I see... The ocean can be a source of joy, as well as fear..."},{"char":"Barton:","dialogue":"All it took was a little practice, and I was able to experience the joy of surfing."},{"char":"Barton:","dialogue":"With the proper methods, as well as plenty of practice..."},{"char":"Barton:","dialogue":"If I can conquer the tidal waves... I might still be able to conquer the entire ocean someday!"},{"char":"Barton:","dialogue":"Hvit! Ulv! Thank you so much!"},{"char":"Barton:","dialogue":"I can\'t waste any more time wallowing in my failures!"},{"char":"Barton:","dialogue":"Oowoooooo!"},{"char":"Hvit/Ulv:","dialogue":"This incident has served to expose our navy\'s weaknesses and shortcomings."},{"char":"Barton:","dialogue":"If a little storm was enough to defeat us, I couldn\'t imagine what would happen if we faced our enemy."},{"char":"Barton:","dialogue":"Our failure was due to a lack of understanding of the sea and a proper strategy for overcoming it."},{"char":"Barton:","dialogue":"That\'s why, from this day forward, we must implement a more rigorous physical training regimen AND a special training program for the navy!"},{"char":"Barton:","dialogue":"Even if we cannot establish a glorious navy during our lifetime, that shouldn\'t be an excuse for us to give up!"},{"char":"Barton:","dialogue":"We will need to sum up our experiences and hardships, and write them down somewhere..."},{"char":"Barton:","dialogue":"So that one day, it will serve as the foundation of Illumina\'s unstoppable navy!"},{"char":"Barton:","dialogue":"Oowoooooo!"},{"char":"Hvit/Ulv:","dialogue":"Come, Hvit! Ulv! Our training begins now!"},{"char":"Barton:","dialogue":"Awoo?"},{"char":"Hvit/Ulv:","dialogue":"Consider yourselves proud soldiers in our grand navy!"},{"char":"Barton:","dialogue":"Woof!"},{"char":"Hvit/Ulv:","dialogue":"Day one of our abandoned island training! Let\'s do some warm-up exercises!"},{"char":"Barton:","dialogue":"Oowooooooooo!"},{"char":"Hvit/Ulv:","dialogue":"With determination and courage, we will conquer the seas!"},{"char":"Barton:","dialogue":"Awoooooo!"},{"char":"Hvit/Ulv:","dialogue":"Starting with a twenty-kilometer run..."},{"char":"Barton:","dialogue":"Ready... Set... Go!"},{"char":"Barton:","dialogue":"Oowoo!"},{"char":"Hvit/Ulv:","dialogue":"Damn, those two are quick! But I can\'t fall behind, either...!"},{"char":"Barton:","dialogue":"On my count!"},{"char":"Barton:","dialogue":"Left! Left! Left, right, left! Hup, two, three, four!"},{"char":"Barton:","dialogue":"Oowooooooooo!"},{"char":"Hvit/Ulv:","dialogue":"Double-time! Hup, two, three, four!"},{"char":"Barton:","dialogue":"Arf, arf, arf, arf!"},{"char":"Hvit/Ulv:","dialogue":"That\'s the spirit! Left! Left! Left, right, left!"},{"char":"Barton:","dialogue":"...The journal entries from the last few days were written by someone that was not me."},{"char":"Barton\'s Diary:","dialogue":"I shall never tremble before a challenge ever again, and I refuse to surrender ever again!"},{"char":"Barton\'s Diary:","dialogue":"If I do nothing, the sea will conquer me someday..."},{"char":"Barton\'s Diary:","dialogue":"But if I keep striving, if I stay active, then someday... there\'s still a chance for me!"},{"char":"Barton\'s Diary:","dialogue":"It\'s never too late..."},{"char":"Barton\'s Diary:","dialogue":"Today is our fiftieth day of training here on this island, and I have an announcement to make!"},{"char":"Barton:","dialogue":"Namely, that our two soldiers, Hvit and Ulv, have performed excellently during their training!"},{"char":"Barton:","dialogue":"In the name of the rear admiral, I now promote you both to the rank of a sergeant!"},{"char":"Barton:","dialogue":"From this day forth, you will be known as Sergeant Hvit and Sergeant Ulv of Illumina\'s Grand Navy!

Awoo!"},{"char":"Sergeant Hvit/Sergeant Ulv:","dialogue":"Good!

A hundred-meter swim in the sea!"},{"char":"Barton:","dialogue":"Oowoooooo!"},{"char":"Sergeant Hvit/Sergeant Ulv:","dialogue":"H-Huh? Why are you so excited...?"},{"char":"Barton:","dialogue":"Ahem... I suppose it\'s only natural. As members of our proud navy, the mere sight of the sea should bring us unbridled joy..."},{"char":"Barton:","dialogue":"Now then... Begin!"},{"char":"Barton:","dialogue":"Awooooooo!"},{"char":"Sergeant Hvit/Sergeant Ulv:","dialogue":"H-Hey! Wait for me!"},{"char":"Barton:","dialogue":"Waaah! The waves are too big!
