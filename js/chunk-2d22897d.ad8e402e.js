While I waited for her to return, and to fulfill the promise I made to her, in the nine years after that, I waited for her in Red-eye Gorge and planted a field of dawn flowers!

I would think that maybe she has always been waiting for me and for the flowers to bloom. I... I didn\'t want to disappoint Eve!Fortunately, Eve and I were reunited in the end. Although it wasn\'t how I expected it, the ending was a good one."}],"story":[],"voice":["Eve\'s home is my home, and her family... is my family.","Illumina... I have nothing but sad memories of that place.","\\"Live life to the fullest!\\" You can\'t go a single day without someone in the Rediesel Wrench hollering that at the top of their lungs.","I used to dominate the Eclipsites of Red-eye Gorge for a time. Pretty impressive, huh?","I swear I\'ll always face the sun, no matter how hot it gets.","I can\'t believe Sinsa is actually Eve\'s older brother... They look nothing alike!","Eve likes flowers. I like them, too.","The sound of burning flames... never fails to take me back to those painful times.","So this is the Colossus that weathered the storm? It smells pretty cool.","I remember I should make a left here, then...","You can count on me, but could you please water Eve\'s flowers for me?","Don\'t panic, just take deep breaths.","An undeniable outcome.","I\'m coming to help!","It\'s over.","Flower blooming.","Happy New Year! My New Year\'s resolution is to see Eve smile even more! What about you? Hmm, that\'s ambitious, but I\'m sure you can do it.","Understood.","I have to control this power...","Some flowers only bloom once in their lives.","Eternity in an instant.","You stopped? I may not be able to see, but I can sense it.","I\'m becoming stronger...","Alchemy Stars.","Compared to eternity, the blooming of a flower is only but a moment in time.","Do you enjoy sitting in the sun? It\'s been ages since I\'ve done it... The sun feels magical on my skin... Although it can startle me sometimes, the warmth can feel nice.","Don\'t worry too much about me. My hearing is pretty good, and I\'ve memorized every hallway and—OW! Who put this table here?","This power isn\'t worth praising... I\'m sure there are some dangers we still don\'t know about. After all, it\'s the power of Eclipsites.","That woman... I bet she\'s conducted even scarier researches than before. Just thinking about it gives me the creeps...","There are definitely others like me and Eve out in the world, and once I find them... I\'ll do everything I can to help them.","Hmm, now we\'re close enough to share secrets with each other... So why don\'t you start?","Not even in my dreams did I think I could have such a care-free life like this. Eve, Sinsa, the Rediesel Wrench... They\'re all my friends, and so are you.","Flowers have a special meaning for Eve and me... They remind us of a time when we had to huddle together for warmth. But we don\'t worry about being lonely anymore... now that we have you.","Yes? I was just getting more familiar with this room\'s layout.","The air in this Colossus is different... Maybe this is what the sky smells like?","Are you there? No wonder it got so lively all of a sudden.","Do you have any plans for today? No? Then why don\'t we take a walk, and maybe bathe in the sun for a bit?","Good morning? At dawn\'s first light, the rising sun scatters the darkness of night. Beautiful, huh?","It\'s cold out tonight. Try not to catch a cold.","You\'re not planning on staying up all night, are you? Why would you do that to yourself?","We meet again. Let\'s set some ground rules for our cooperation: No picking on Eve, no making her unhappy, and no letting her go hungry. Understand?","Thanks for the gift.","I\'ll treasure this.","You\'re more considerate than I imagined.","Our minds appear to be in tune with each other.","Now, let\'s go!","Never forget this moment.","Seize the opportunity!","My mother, and that woman... All they care about was research and experiments, but I never would\'ve met Eve if it wasn\'t for them. Maybe this is destiny...","I\'ll never forget those days in the laboratory. Eve was always there for me... Her kindness and purity made me feel that maybe the outside world wasn\'t so bad... that maybe I could sit in the sun again.","The past is the past. We don\'t need to endure that kind of suffering anymore. I just wish these days would never end... And I\'ll do whatever I must to for that wish come true.","Can I do it?"],"skins":[],"description":"Dark powers caused her to lose sight in both eyes.
