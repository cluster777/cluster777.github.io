So, although it\'s not obvious based on my appearance, I can handle anything as long as it\'s related to machinery!I\'ve come here this time on a tech personnel exchange, but I\'m not here to take advantage of you.

After that, somehow, inexplicably, I was surrounded by a group of men who treated me as their mascot. Although I encountered all sorts of strange dangers when I was with them, the danger was nothing compared to what we gained along the way.At this point, I won\'t need to scare you with my wrench anymore, so I\'m just gonna go ahead and tell you that I\'m very interested in the purification technology of your Colossus!

I\'m not wearing it because they put a lot of effort into making it...However, this can\'t go on forever... although they\'re all big and tall men, they can\'t fight in the dark no matter how powerful they are, right?
