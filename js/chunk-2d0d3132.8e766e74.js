He\'d return after six months at most when he went out catching worms, bringing home load of trophies and pretty pebbles from the desert. But that time he was gone for ten years. We pictured bad—and even the worst—scenarios. Mother and I didn\'t believe it would happen, though, because father was very tough and would be fine. Besides, a lot of Eclipsites started showing up around the village, so it was probably safer for him not to be there. No news is good news, right?But I was still worried about him. How could I not?

Ugh, I\'m still angry thinking about it!Of course, I forgave him after he explained why he couldn\'t send letters. His team ran into Eclipsites, got chased to the other end of the desert and hid in the ruins. They ran out of food and water eventually, and even their weapons began breaking down, so they stayed hidden in the ruins and scrounged for ten harsh years. He never gave up though, and kept looking for an opportunity to go home. He also brought me a pebble from where he lived in the ruins.

That was when I\'d be motivated to have a good showing for him, so I... uh, I didn\'t mean to use that much explosive on purpose. I just get excited, that\'s all.
