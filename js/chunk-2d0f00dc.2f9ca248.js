Just thinking about the repair bills makes my head hurt!"},{"char":"Vice:","dialogue":"Navigator, our savings are at stake here..."},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"Vice, just try to calm down a little..."},{"char":"Vice:","dialogue":"I\'m trying! But really, who would do such a thing on the Colossus!?"},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"Vice, nothing has happened yet. Don\'t get carried away..."},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"Your tail is flailing around all over the place!"},{"char":"Vice:","dialogue":"Hey... What was that sound?"},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"Your tail... knocked the wooden sign down."},{"char":"???:","dialogue":"So, it was you... You dare to challenge the Colossus\' mightiest—Revy?"},{"char":"Vice/Navigator:","dialogue":"Eeeek!"},{"char":"Reventon:","dialogue":"Yes, Vice—the long-tailed archer, have come here to challenge me, you do?"},{"char":"Vice:","dialogue":"No, no, no..."},{"char":"Vice:","dialogue":"Look, Revy! I don\'t want to challenge anyone! My tail accidentally knocked the sign down, see?"},{"char":"Vice:","dialogue":"Wait... \\"Challenge me\\"? You mean, you\'re the one who put this sign here?"},{"char":"Reventon:","dialogue":"Of course, I did."},{"char":"Vice:","dialogue":"So, that means... Revy, are you, uh, the Colossus\' mightiest?"},{"char":"Reventon:","dialogue":"You think so, too? Ah, but of course! Heroic minds think alike."},{"char":"Vice:","dialogue":"Ahaha... So, you\'re waiting here for someone to challenge you?"},{"char":"Reventon:","dialogue":"Aye, and you are the first one to touch that wooden sign."},{"char":"Vice:","dialogue":"Right... But Revy, you showed up the moment I touched it!"},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"Yeah...

Was it that obvious?"},{"char":"Reventon:","dialogue":"And it was Vice who touched my wooden sign first."},{"char":"Reventon:","dialogue":"So now, Vice must challenge me.

It was really only just a teeny tiny little accident..."},{"char":"Reventon:","dialogue":"But you still touched it."},{"char":"Vice:","dialogue":"Hmm... How about we just skip the challenge and agree that you\'re the mightiest?"},{"char":"Reventon:","dialogue":"That won\'t do! Only through mortal combat can I prove that I am worthy of the title \\"The Colossus\' Mightiest\\"!"},{"char":"Vice:","dialogue":"How did I get myself into this mess...!?"},{"char":"Reventon:","dialogue":"Are you ready to commence our fated duel?"},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"Erm, Revy... How about you put down your weapon, and we try talking this out...?"},{"char":"Reventon:","dialogue":"Very well."},{"char":"Vice:","dialogue":"The thing is, all of us living on the Colossus are on the same side. There\'s no need to be going around challenging each other..."},{"char":"Vice:","dialogue":"And what\'s more... we\'re both Illumina soldiers!"},{"char":"Reventon:","dialogue":"Soldiers must also hone their fighting skills amongst themselves."},{"char":"Reventon:","dialogue":"And that goes doubly for soldiers on the front line!

What do you say?"},{"char":"Reventon:","dialogue":"Deny there is some truth in your words, I cannot, but I see no harm in promoting a little healthy competition."},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"You two, how about we take a break and talk about this later?"},{"char":"Fireflies:","dialogue":"Break time!

You\'re giving me a headache!"},{"char":"Vice:","dialogue":"Navigator! I\'m not trying to cause anyone a headache... We were just engaging in a reasonable discussion. Allies should never fight!"},{"char":"Reventon:","dialogue":"You should know, detest arguing, I do..."},{"char":"Reventon:","dialogue":"And fighting? I said we should merely engage in friendly competition. Although, some might say there is no difference in the meaning of these two words."},{"char":"Vice:","dialogue":"There is no difference!
