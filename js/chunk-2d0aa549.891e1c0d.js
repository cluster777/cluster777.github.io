But when I finally met the elder, he looked at me, shook his head and, like mother, say to me, \\"Not you...\\" It hit me like a curse and made my blood boil. Naturally, I did the elder no harm and simply left the tower, returning to Umbraton. I already decided not to have anything to do with my family, yet the damn bloodline in me wouldn\'t let me. All I could do is trying to suppress it the best I can. Then, I saw that foolish sister of mine on the battlefield, who was seemingly unaware of the whole story of the Kartima Family.

When you close your eyes, you are handing others the power to execute you.","Purely, with simply desire.","Alchemy, Stars.","What do I fight for? What a foolish question... I fight for myself of course! Or do you think it\'s for the nonexistent golden fruit in the garden?","I don\'t need weapons. My wings and claws are all I need. Let the flames of my bloody path burn everything, or come forward and crush everything myself.","Those who should bear the wrath of dragons should take it, just like those who must suffer shall suffer. This is not an excuse to disturb the Shadowlord.","Judgment? It\'s their voices, that are too noisy. They seek to ignite my blood in the hope that I\'ll destroy everything, but unfortunately, I won\'t.","Don\'t get me wrong. The hatred flowing through my heart has nothing to do with the hatred I seek to vent. After all, the stronger we are, the blinder we become.","Darkness and blood are nothing but illusions as both hatred and love are crushed into dust and the returning dragon has fallen into it—","The only thing that flows through the bloodline of dragons is hatred, but I have always made decisions based on my mood. You will understand that soon.","Are you curious about my covered right eye? Maybe I should take off this eye patch and let you experience what it feels like to be choked by hatred.","You adorable kiddo, don\'t think about what you can do for me. You just need to obey me obediently... or have endless arguments with me.","Letting an ignoramus bear the burden of destiny and curse, hmm, that sounds like a fascinating interest.","All of us will eventually be engulfed by our own foolishness. Until that day comes, struggle, struggle as we should.","What is it? I happen to be in a good mood... No, you should try to make me happier.","Oh—I know, a kid is here.","Hey little cutie, come shake my hand. Your struggling will be quite the greeting, don\'t you think?","You always seem to be drawn back to my side... Even though, unfortunately, I am not the special one.","There aren\'t many pitiful people who are still awake at this hour... Go to keep that kid company, Sunstone.","All you need to know is that the image reflected in my eye is my hometown that is covered in a dead fog. As for my name, you\'ll find out over time...","What\'s this? ...Not even Sunstone wants to touch it.","Sunstone, take this kid\'s gift away.","The look of hesitation on your face looks even cuter compared to this gift.","This expression of yours is enough to make me like it.","Send them to hell, Sunstone.","Well then. Crush everything into dust!","Don\'t hold back. Go.","Staring at her twice made me wonder if I should just appear before her and announce that the thing we seek is nothing but a joke.","Taking revenge against the innocents does nothing to dissolve this grudge that has fused into the essence of my blood, but the one I wish to exact revenge against no longer exists.","Blood, memories, the whirlpool of revenge, and the accumulation of history. Everything is entangled in the identity of a dragon, and it is utterly disgusting.","I have stepped out of hatred, but I miss it so dearly."],"skins":[],"description":"The maverick of Umbraton who possesses Dragon Power.
