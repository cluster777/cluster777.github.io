As the captain of the Guardians of Lumopolis Gardens, I was responsible for a lot of follow-ups, coordinating with the coalition forces, and maintaining public order in Lumopolis back then. I also needed to look closely to eradicate Eclipsites and immoral dregs who had caused riots. Now that I think about it, I was unbelievably busy during that time, and I probably wouldn\'t have been able to recover if I didn\'t have such a strong foundation.My direct subordinate, Yeanu, who joined the Guardians later, is like a plant that has withered at a young age, a wastepaper basket with a hole in the bottom, or a little donkey that has never stopped working since it was born—he didn\'t have a single trace of vitality. Look at him now and you might gain some insight into how busy I was with work at that time...However, things have changed for the better after Ms. Carleen joined the Guardians of Lumopolis Gardens.

I don\'t need to make them more powerful as they already grew powerful enough before I realized it. Are you also curious about this cage? It has accompanied me for a long time—far longer than I can remember... I don\'t mind if people call it a birdcage, but it\'s more like a guardian than a form of restraint. I stay inside it voluntarily, and accept the nature it has granted me, making me more peaceful and calm, which is very important as it helps me prevent things from happening again, things that I don\'t want to happen, and stops me from remembering certain feelings that I don\'t want to remember...

Countless Eclipsites were lured over to me when I tried to move my branches and leaves. It might actually have been better if I had died in that place.For some reason, luck is always on my side. An unknown Aurorian protected me and helped me repair my cage, which is something even I can\'t manage. I knew beyond doubt that he is an expert with profound knowledge.When I met that expert, I realized that he was old and frail, and his time was running out.
