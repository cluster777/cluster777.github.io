This is...?"},{"char":"Nemesis:","dialogue":"Surprised? They\'re all made of metal."},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"Yeah, especially this chair. It looks heavy..."},{"char":"Nemesis:","dialogue":"It\'s cast iron, so is the dresser. The shutters on the windows are made of tin-plated steel, and the cups are made from light-weight clad aluminum."},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"So they are... This cup looks heavy, too..."},{"char":"Nemesis:","dialogue":"It just takes some time to get used to, plus it\'s a great arm workout."},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"Oh, so you enjoy working out, Nemesis? I remember there\'s an exercise center on the Colossus..."},{"char":"Nemesis:","dialogue":"Oh, hmm... It\'s nothing like that. I just find metal products more durable."},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"Durable? Hmm... Oh, I get it now, Nemesis!"},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"You must have a pet or something, right? You don\'t want it to break anything and that\'s why..."},{"char":"Nemesis:","dialogue":"No, it\'s for me."},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"You?"},{"char":"Nemesis:","dialogue":"Believe it or not, but I just happen to break things pretty often."},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"But you don\'t seem like a very temperamental person, and I\'ve never seen you throw anything on the Colossus. Unless..."},{"char":"Nemesis:","dialogue":"It\'s because of work."},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"Work? You\'re the General Inspector, not a plumber..."},{"char":"Nemesis:","dialogue":"It\'s because of justice, okay! Justice burns in my heart like a fire, and sometimes I just can\'t help it..."},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"I don\'t think I understand..."},{"char":"Nemesis:","dialogue":"When I\'m reading case files and I see all those injustices, I tend to crush whatever I\'m holding in my hand."},{"char":"Nemesis:","dialogue":"Even when I\'m not reading case files, just thinking about those injustices riles me up do the same."},{"char":"Nemesis:","dialogue":"I never noticed it before. There was even a week when I shattered 97 glasses before Chief Vivian pointed it out to me."},{"char":"Nemesis:","dialogue":"That\'s when I decided to swap out all of my furnishings for metal ones since they\'re fairly durable."},{"char":"Nemesis:","dialogue":"That way, whenever I\'m riled up seeing or thinking about those injustices, I won\'t break anything."},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"I see. I never realized you were such an ardent General Inspector..."},{"char":"Nemesis:","dialogue":"It also has to do with the reason I asked you to come today."},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"Oh, right. You haven\'t told me yet. What is it?"},{"char":"Nemesis:","dialogue":"I need you to deliver something to Vice."},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"Huh... Let me guess, it\'s made out of glass, isn\'t it?"},{"char":"Nemesis:","dialogue":"Yes!"},{"char":"Nemesis:","dialogue":"Messenger!"},{"char":"Illumina Soldier:","dialogue":"Here is the item you requested, General Inspector."},{"char":"Nemesis:","dialogue":"Very good, leave it on the table."},{"char":"Nemesis:","dialogue":"Open it and take a look, Navigator."},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"Oh... It\'s a dining set?"},{"char":"Nemesis:","dialogue":"Yes, a porcelain coffee cup, two plates, and a glass cover."},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"You prepared these for Vice?"},{"char":"Nemesis:","dialogue":"A few days ago, Vice was granted the Field Service Award. This is the prize."},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"Field Service Award? What is it?"},{"char":"Nemesis:","dialogue":"Er... If I had to say, it\'s an award for those who frequently work on the field. It\'s Chief Vivian\'s idea, so I don\'t really know the specifics."},{"char":"Nemesis:","dialogue":"Since Chief Vivian is so busy, she asked me to hand these out to the three award recipients, and Vice is one of them."},{"char":"Nemesis:","dialogue":"But I\'m not exactly the best at handling glass objects..."},{"char":"Nemesis:","dialogue":"It\'s best if a person receives their prize from someone they\'re close to, so I thought of you."},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"I see, that\'s no problem at all! So just Vice?"},{"char":"Nemesis:","dialogue":"Well, there\'s Charon and Philyshy too, but I\'ve already entrusted their prizes to someone else for delivery."},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"I understand. I\'ll take this to her right now."},{"char":"Nemesis:","dialogue":"Oh, please give her this message when you deliver her prize:"},{"char":"Nemesis:","dialogue":"\\"This is from Chief Vivian, in recognition of your actions on that day, one month ago.\\""},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"Is that all?"},{"char":"Nemesis:","dialogue":"Yes."},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"It sounds... A little vague."},{"char":"Nemesis:","dialogue":"Yes, but it\'s what Chief Vivian planned, so just go ahead with it."},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"Alright then, I\'ll be on my way."},{"char":"Nemesis:","dialogue":"Don\'t forget."},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"No problem!"},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"(Vice... She should still be on the Colossus. I\'ll go take a look around.)"},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"Ah! There you are, Vice!"},{"char":"Vice:","dialogue":"Hmm? What\'s this, Navigator?"},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"Your Field Service Award."},{"char":"Vice:","dialogue":"Field Service Award? Weird, must be a new award... Since when did the higher-ups start feeling so generous..."},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"It was Chief Vivian\'s idea."},{"char":"Vice:","dialogue":"The Chief of Staff?"},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"Yep! Oh, there\'s a message too!"},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"\\"This is from Chief Vivian, in recognition of your actions on that day, one month ago.\\""},{"char":"Vice:","dialogue":"One month ago..."},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"Is something wrong, Vice? You look..."},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"You don\'t like your prize?"},{"char":"Vice:","dialogue":"It\'s... That\'s not it!"},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"(Her voice sounds strained and her smile looks forced.)"},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"(Has Vice seen this dining set before?)"},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"Um... Are you okay, Vice?"},{"char":"Vice:","dialogue":"Hmm? I\'m fine. I just need some rest. This is a beautiful prize. See you later."},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"Huh? Vice?"},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"(Strange... Does that mean she doesn\'t like it?)"},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"(Or does Vice have the same weird tendency to break glass objects?)"},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"(No way... Never mind, I think I\'ll just go now...)"},{"char":"The next day, on the Bridge","dialogue":"There you are, Navigator."},{"char":"Nemesis:","dialogue":"Hey Nemesis, have some free time to visit the Bridge today?"},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"Did you deliver that prize to Vice?"},{"char":"Nemesis:","dialogue":"Yeah, I gave it to her yesterday.

Did you see the reason? Was it the gift?"},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"It didn\'t seem like it."},{"char":"Nemesis:","dialogue":"Then what was it?"},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"I... I think it was the message you told me to give her."},{"char":"Nemesis:","dialogue":"That means Vice is..."},{"char":"Nemesis:","dialogue":"So that\'s it..."},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"Uh...
