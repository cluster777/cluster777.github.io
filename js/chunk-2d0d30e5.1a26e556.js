However, I won\'t take responsibility for the recipient\'s mood at the time of the delivery..."},{"file_name":"Her Story (III)","files":"I don\'t really like the Rediesel Desert, but I guess I don\'t hate it either! The point is that I\'m used to it. My parents were both members of the Courier Union, so I followed them everywhere in the desert since I was a child. When they were injured and could no longer deliver letters, I took their job as the communicator of the Rediesel Wrench, the Illumina, and Lumopolis... Although I don\'t want to admit it, I was young at that time and my wings weren\'t as strong as they are now! I would run out of strength while flying in the desert and would even get lost... Either way, it was completely inefficient at that time! That\'s why Sinsa made me a jetpack! Yes... This one!My wings become more powerful as I grow older, and with the assistance of my jetpack... When I fly in the Rediesel Desert now, I speed through the air like a small hurricane missile, making a whoosh sound!That\'s right! Do you want me to show you? Huh? No? Hmph!"},{"file_name":"Her Story (IV)","files":"Oh yeah, have you ever seen hordes of Eclipsites when you were a kid? Ah, you\'ve been living here since you were young? Then you must not have seen them before!I once saw a large group of Eclipsites in the desert when I was a child! A really large group! We were going to seek refuge in a hurry, but my parents decided to warn the desert residents first... They did something really great back then. I\'m telling you, all the inhabitants of the desert respected them greatly at that time!The war against the Eclipsites broke out after that. My parents were members of the Courier Union, but they were just ordinary people. They were injured in the war and couldn\'t pass on information to Rediesel Wrench... Don\'t you agree that someone must do this amazing work? I was still very young back then, but having learned a lot already from my parents, I started to help them deliver letters! They were very worried about me at first, but I think I must have done a good job, so gradually they began to trust me! What? What\'s this about me playing dead? W-who did you hear that from! T-that was a very long time ago!Ahem, anyway, I\'m now a famous courier in the Rediesel Desert. I may not be as respected as my parents, but I should be fine since I\'m so brave!"}],"voice":["Hehe, the Courier Union is so awesome! Though it runs on a small scale, it can do anything!","Tsk, so what if the recipients are Rediesel Wrench people? Won\'t they become spiritless after just a while of playing around?","The Courier Union always delivers!","Are Eclipsites scary? Hmm? I\'m invincible as long as they have knee caps!","Dove stood me up again! I\'m gonna pull out all her feathers one day!","She has a super loud voice and a Speaker, delivers with ultra speed, and loses a lot of feathers as well, cool—","I like collecting feathers, flying at wind speed, and aiming at knee caps!","I—hate slimy things the most! Just thinking about them sticking onto my feathers makes me, Eww!","Isn\'t the Colossus a Speaker? What\'s the difference? Oh, it isn\'t alive... How weird.","What do you want me to deliver? I can deliver to anywhere.","Ah, yes, as expected, you have a discerning eye! This is my territory from now on! Wahaha!","By the wind, I almost had to play dead!","Wind speed for the victory!","Wind speed kick!","Wind speed attack!","Wind speed—check!","Woohoo! Happy New Year!","Want me to slow down?","Wow! I\'m so amazing!","The small wind is transforming into a small hurricane!","I\'m now ready to challenge this continent!","I\'m so bored that my feathers are about to fall out! Come play with me! What? How can the feathers falling out from me moving about and doing nothing be the same?","A faster and stronger me!","Alchemy Stars!","A brave person like me doesn\'t need to play silly tricks like playing dead... Do childhood events count? Of course not!","If that reckless Sinsa wants to grab you, just kick him in his knee caps, like this—hiya! It works every time!","The desert is either extremely hot or extremely cold. Someone without a down jacket like you probably won\'t even survive for three days, right? Tsk, tsk, tsk...","Why am I so obsessed with wind speed? Do you see my short and powerful wings? You still don\'t get it? Take another look then. Come closer!","This is my three-piece travel gear—a heat-insulating, cold-proof and ultra-light down jacket, a pair of too-cool-for-school wind goggles, and a high-tech jetpack! Awesome, aren\'t they?","It doesn\'t matter if it\'s dangerous because you can turn or escape mid-way! The most important thing is the ability to fly that first meter and the courage to take on the challenge!","Oh? Wanna touch my wings? Come on, touch them if you aren\'t afraid of them hitting you! There\'s nothing to be afraid of, the worst that could happen is being slammed unconscious!","Come closer, don\'t be afraid... What do I want to do with you? I can do whatever I want, of course! Do you think you can resist? Hehe!","Don\'t be afraid. Now, swagger forward after me! I\'ll teach anyone who dares to bully you a lesson! Hehehe, as for me, well, we\'re close!","Can you turn around for me? ...So you really have no tail feathers at all... Don\'t you feel cold?","Wait for me to inflate the jetpack... How? Blow into it of course! ...Blow into it and then add fuel.","What should we do when we meet our enemies? Just charge at them first of course. If anything goes wrong, you can always turn around!","Oh! You\'re finally back! Cheer up and move your weak hands for me!","Awake already? Here, I\'m sure you\'ll wake up after I give you two... Two what? Knee-massages!","Delicious, dried sandworms, dried lizards, and dried earthworms! Do you want a bite? Hehehe, try it!","You can\'t sleep? Let me fan you! ...it\'s just fanning k, don\'t be so nervous.","Correct! I\'m a high-speed elliptical missile that travels in the desert, known as the Light Speed Spiral, the cute and brave courier, Wendy!","Why did you pass me this? Wanna deliver it?","So, I\'m the recipient as usual?","Hehehe, it seems like you know what do to.","I\'ve received it! A gift I like! Woohoo!","Wind speed landing!","There are so many wind speed that I don\'t know what to call it!","I\'ll show you what wind speed is like!","It\'s really easy to find a recipient? There are only so many people who live in the desert. Just go after them one by one... Unless the recipient is already gone, haha.","Speakers are usually creatures that have been tamed. I don\'t have one yet... Should I go and catch one? Hehehe, come closer, don\'t be afraid...","Ever seen a sea of Eclipsites? I\'ve been there when I was a rookie. You know, the hard-working bird gets the worm. I can\'t help it that I\'m so awesome!","Can you keep up with my wind speed attacks?"],"skins":[],"description":"A member of the Courier Union who is responsible for the Rediesel Wrench area.
