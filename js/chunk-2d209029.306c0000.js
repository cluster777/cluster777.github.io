I was very different back then. I was thin and short, with scrawny arms and legs. If not for this necklace, I would have been the one beaten on the ground! That was when I started to pay attention to it. I\'ve been wearing it since I could remember. If it wasn\'t for the events from that time, I would have continued to think it was just a nice-looking, ordinary gem.I have collected countless gems over the years while running the Odd Jobs. Although they are all special in one way or another, none of them were like the one I carried. I grew increasingly curious about its secrets, as well as why my parents left this item to me. Later, I became an ally of Umbraton, and the condition I made was to get the Shadowlord to investigate the secret of this gem for me. The Shadowlord is mysterious and powerful. I\'m sure I\'ll be one step closer to solving the mystery with his help.It\'s not like I have to know its secrets. I\'m more curious about my birth and origin than this necklace itself..."}],"story":[],"voice":["Umbraton is a good place to gather intel, and no one there talks crap. I like it.","I\'ll join Rediesel Wrench after I find out the secrets of the necklace. I\'m quite fond of those people.","The shadow is watching you.","A bunch of trash with absolutely no wits. They have no value to speak of.","Istvan is really good at managing Umbraton. It\'s rather peaceful here with him around.","I wonder how the little pink-haired girl is doing. Ah, to hell with it. I\'m not gonna think about it.","Having booze to drink is enough for me in this lifetime.","There were a few part-timers here, but I fired them because they talked too much.","This bloke is too big. I can\'t even find my way around in here. And there are way too many identical rooms.","If you have something to say, just say it. Stop faffing about.","Want me to keep watch? Got it. The Odd Jobs does everything, doesn\'t it?","Defeated? It\'s part of everyday life.","It wasn\'t even difficult.","It\'s over.","Too slow!","It\'s time.","Happy New Year, kid. This discount coupon is for you.","Oh, we\'re doing this?","Humph, it was nothing but a child\'s play.","I\'m getting closer... to finding out the secrets of the necklace.","Blood pumping... It\'s been a while since I\'ve been this fired up!","Don\'t you have anything to do? Or are you really busy, kid?","Not bad.","Alchemy Stars.","Friends? What makes you think I need any of those? Though I did have one when I was a boy...","Of course there is a commission fee. How much? It depends on the contents.","Don\'t you think running an Odd Jobs is easy... I always have to host strange people, like that guy with a dog and the guy with tentacles.","My strength is definitely getting stronger, but I am still far from finding out the secret of the necklace.","No one at the Odd Jobs can work with you to save the world, so save your breath and stop looking.","There is no equality in this world. There is no equality where there are people.","You\'re a really weird kid, but I don\'t dislike you.","You\'re nothing like those brats in the Far East. What? It\'s unusual of me to compliment you, so just accept it.","Not many people in Umbraton are willing to build relationships with others. Everyone is held back by one thing or another, which makes it very hard for them to think about anything other than survival.","Enough. You\'ve seen enough. Or do you want to try this?","Since you have so much free time, you should go do your own stuff.","I have to find out the secrets of this necklace as soon as possible.","You\'re in good spirit, kid. Wanna help me with my business? You\'ll get paid, of course.","How long are you going to sleep in, kid? You\'d be off to work by now if you\'re with Odd Jobs!","Come on, have a drink with me. It\'s on me. You can have juice. I don\'t care.","You\'re a real tour de force, kid, still working so hard at this hour. Wanna have a drink with me?","Is there something you want to commission me to do, kid? It better not be anything trivial. There are only so many things the Odd Jobs can get done in a day, so I must be very selective.","Are you trying to bribe me?","I\'ll take it. Thank you.","You\'ve got quite an eye for stuff.","This is—! Thanks, kid.","Burn them all!","Incinerate everything!","Watch this!","The world is not very friendly to those who are different. Some are even treated badly just because of their looks, but it\'s a lot better here in Umbraton.","To this day, the time I spent in the Far East still feels like yesterday. The teachings of my master still echo in my mind, and there was this pink-haired girl whom I somehow care about.","This necklace... is something I\'ve been carrying around since I could remember. It\'s a legacy from my parents and is also the source of my power. There are so many secrets behind it, but I don\'t know any of them.","I\'m not used to leading a team."],"skins":[],"description":"The proprietor of Odd Jobs who traveled from the Far East, eventually settling in Umbraton.
