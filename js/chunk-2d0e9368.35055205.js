He would make a simple analysis of the situation and quickly make a judgment.Although his insights were unique and his rhetoric was rigorous, I still identified some loopholes. I don\'t know if it was because I was young enough that I dared to speak my mind or if it was because I was so confident in my thoughts that I pointed out the Shadowlord\'s mistake. Everyone stared at me, a 13-year-old little girl. I heard them whispering, and they all seemed to think that I was in serious trouble... Unexpectedly, the Shadowlord started laughing after freezing momentarily. Then he walked over to me, lowered his head, and asked me in all seriousness if I\'d like to join his gang as the crowd grew even noisier. I accepted his offer because I was curious about his approach to things and his methods.

It wasn\'t until I joined the gang in Umbraton that I started to learn more about Umbraton and this continent. I gradually understood why the city above us didn\'t dispatch even a single soldier to save us back then—those selfish nobles ignored the civilians\' plea for help only to protect themselves. Over time, I\'ve learned the rules of this world and realized how incompetent I am...I want to continue recording everything that happens in this city as a witness. Even if I can\'t change anything, at least I can record and bear witness to it.I told the Shadowlord what I was thinking and then got assistance from him.

As time passed, my initial indignation gradually became indifference. Like Umbraton, they have their own order there and no one is allowed to question it.

No rest for me yet.","I must put these records into the Marmon Box or I won\'t be at ease...","I chronicled Umbraton\'s history, along with the order and chaos in the dark alleys, in pen and paper. Signed, Jane, Witness.","I\'ll document this gift in the books.","I\'ll pay you back. I promise.","Thank you, it\'ll be really helpful!","This is...! I can\'t express my gratitude in words...","Let\'s end it all!","It\'s over, you greedy lot!","Let\'s begin.","Istvan and Sheol both invited me to join them, but I just want to be a chronicler for Umbraton. I have no interest in ruling the town.","If you pay attention, be it a noble or a civilian, everyone has a side that belongs to them and one that doesn\'t.","Umbraton was attacked by Eclipsites, and my mother was killed as a result. Many people raged against the Lumopolis, which had sat idly by, yet I do not hold a grudge against them.","I\'ll document everyone\'s performance."],"skins":[{"name":"Midnight Phantom","description":"An eerily alluring outfit composed of a captivating top, elegant skirt, beautifully woven sleeves, a ceremonial veil, and stylish boots...
