Is it true that all Caelestites have them, or is it just you? In any case, it seems that your situation is similar to mine.Strange sounds have filled my head since I was a child, undulating rhythmically, just like music. At first, my family thought I was ill, so they took me to see a doctor, more than once. However, they always came to the conclusion that everything was normal.This went on for a while, and the auditory illusions became more and more real. One day, several phantasmal figures appeared around me. Later, I learned that these were Holy Avatars. They allowed me to truly connect with music and guided me in my search for the Ultimate Movement. That\'s why I joined the True Order, because according to the clues Victoria has managed to gather, the \\"Truth\\" they are looking for is related to the \\"Ultimate Movement,\\" too."},{"file_name":"Her Story (II)","files":"I was born in Gascogne, a town built on the crafting of musical instruments, which are mainly sold to Lumopolis. Coming from a family of scholars, I have been immersed in the world of music since childhood and was also taken to see the performances of various renowned orchestras. Becoming a conductor was almost a matter of course. See my glasses? I took to the stage when I was 7 years old and put these on so I\'d look more like a conductor. I\'ve been wearing them ever since.When I was a child, I was forced to practice music daily, for hours on end, and so I really hated music—that was until I realized that the hallucinations I had been hearing and seeing were in fact a form of divine intervention, which would allow me to find a movement that contains all the music in the world and also represents the voice of the divine.Moreover, since it is a representation of the divine, this movement should also be able to answer the question that has always been in my heart: Why did this divine voice choose me?"},{"file_name":"Her Story (III)","files":"Everyone in Gascogne loves music, and my parents are no exception. When they saw my extraordinary musical talent shine through from such a young age, they forced me to endure painstaking training. Why was I forced into such training? Because that was the kind of training employed in Lumopolis, yet the voices in my mind told me: This is not right.Because Lumopolis knows nothing about music.Unfortunately, nobody in Jascony understood this, and they also taught me in the Lumopolis tradition. As a result, when Lumopolis came here to select up-and-coming talents, naturally, the mediocre candidates who were most in line with their tired standards were favored. Pfft...This inevitably aggravated me, in my young and immature state. I locked myself in my room and dedicated myself to music, vowing to compose a movement that would shock the world, but nothing came. It was all because my inspiration was stifled by the teaching methods of Lumopolis, which directly oppose the essence of music.I continued in this way for two years, until... that voice appeared, and I finally found my own way."},{"file_name":"Her Story (IV)","files":"As I told you before, I shut myself off from the world for two years, trying to write the perfect movement. But... I didn\'t write a single phrase.I finally realized the extent of my failure and realized the depth of my obsession with Lumopolis. I had intended on writing a musical score... In fact, all I did was write \\"Lumopolis knows nothing about music\\" repeatedly in one blank book after another until these books were all full and stacked in a heap.And then, one day, upon awakening, I heard that babble, that illusory voice that I had been hearing since I was a child—but this time, what it said struck true. A score suddenly filled my heart, and my hand started moving, conducting as if it had a mind of its own. The spectral figure I had seen as a child appeared and watched my raised hand, then began to play the most wonderful music.With a deafening burst of sound, my house collapsed. My parents and neighbors said that it was hit by a meteorite, but what puzzled them most was that I crawled out of the rubble without a single scratch on me... Only I knew that this meteorite was summoned by my divine music, and was the embodiment of true inspiration\'s majesty.Thus, I embarked on my path to find the source of this divine music, and I believe that it can be found in the Ultimate Movement."}],"story":[],"voice":["The True Order is much better than Lumopolis.
