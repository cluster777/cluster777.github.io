See what I did there?","I got your backs covered!","Burrowing is the way!","Hooray! My drill just got upgraded!","No matter where, dig through, and break through!","Okay, we\'ll go with that for Plan E. Now for Plan F...","My drill\'s even more powerful now!","Alchemy Stars!","Where\'s the next fight? I\'ll make a getaway plan first, in case we can\'t handle the heat!","Hm? Something feels off! Hide! Or else...","Boo-hoo... I got scolded for digging through the cabin again... I was just researching old materials, just in case...","I\'m getting back to studying optical camouflage again! With it, we can slip away from enemies right under their noses!","Check it out! The latest drill head! Wooots! I can almost smell the fragrance of newly dug soil just by touching it!","With this kind of power, it\'ll cut through the ground like a hot knife through butter... Mmm... Butter... Yummm...","You have no concept of danger. As I\'ve stressed to my squad members, planning, anticipation, and forethought are very important!","I miss my grandpa so much. Maybe he\'s still protecting me, that\'s why I can always get away safe and sound... or is it because of that other rabbit?","Don\'t forget the escape route I showed you. It\'s okay to lose as long as you live to fight another day","Wh-what is that sound? Oh! It\'s just you. Thank goodness. I almost jumped out the window.","When is the equipment that I ordered going to be delivered? I guess I\'ll just have to wait...for 5 more minutes!","I feel safe whenever I\'m with you. Oh, but I do have our escape route planned!","You\'re back! I\'ve come up with our escape route... Huh? We\'re not escaping?","Good morning! Let\'s discuss a new plan, something that ends with \\"route\\"!","Whoa! Welcome back! I\'m not doing anything suspicious. Not at all!","Not resting yet? Can\'t sleep? Feeling insecure? I can dig a hole for you!","I\'m Rabbie, the getaway master! Don\'t let the big drill scare ya! It\'s just used to ensure our escape route!","Hmmm... Let me think... So how do I use it?","Hmm! I hope I can make use of it!","For me? Really? Thanks!","Oh, my! I\'ve always wanted that!","You won\'t get away!","There\'s no way out for you!","Awaiting your order!","Rules of Retreat: One, know why you\'re retreating! Two, run like the wind! Three, save the drama for later!","Our leader is strong, and I have a bunch of reliable friends now, so I no longer have to run away by myself... Leave it to me, I\'ll guard the escape route!","If you can\'t run? I\'ll protect you just as my grandpa protected me, but you\'ll need to wait till I get a bit taller.","Safety first, everyone!"],"skins":[],"description":"She may be short, but she\'s already a captain in Rediesel Wrench.
