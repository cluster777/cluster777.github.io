No one was willing to admit that it was their problem! Illumina did me dirty no matter how I thought about it! Although they did help Eve and me this time, it doesn\'t mean that our past grievances have been wiped clean. Our score is far from settled!"},{"file_name":"His Story (III)","files":"By the way, kid, what do you think of my crew? They\'re pretty good, right? What? You\'re not used to them... Well, I certainly didn\'t expect that. They all got along pretty well with Eve since the first time they met her. How peculiar... but you\'ll get used to them eventually, so don\'t sweat it! If you don\'t, then... I can\'t help you either!You probably don\'t know this, but I have a bit of an ill-fated relationship with my crew! Many of them were unhappy when I was elected as the leader and yammered on about why a brat like me was elected to lead Rediesel Wrench! I even fought them over this... Of course, I won in the end! We were all exhausted after that, so we sat together and drank all night. I guess we just broke the ice like that, hahaha! They may look like a group of weirdos, but they get along terrifically with me! Since then, we became comrades who trust each other with our lives. All I have is Rediesel Wrench, and all Rediesel Wrench has is me...So, kiddo, are you really not going to join us even after I\'ve told you so much?"},{"file_name":"His Story (IV)","files":"Kid, do you remember what I told you about Eve before? I\'m really blessed now. I have comrades, family, and a future I look forward to. But do you know how Eve and I survived the past nine years...?In those years, I watched her body get weaker and weaker, but there was nothing I could do. Even if I clenched my fist, all I could do was punch powerlessly at the sky. I watched her struggle and yell in pain every night. I... I couldn\'t do anything other than hug her tightly. I made a difficult decision back then—I sent her to an isolation chamber deep in the Rediesel Desert... I knew she might feel lonely or scared, but there was nothing I could do to help her recover. Only the isolation chamber there could barely keep her alive... Even if there was only a 0.1% chance of success, I would not let this opportunity slip by!The past nine years were like a nightmare, and the bond between Eve and I was the only light that illuminated my nightmare. Fortunately, everything is over now. We have finally woken up from this long dream..."}],"story":[],"voice":["Don\'t judge us by our ragtag appearance.
