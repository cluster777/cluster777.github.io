The cabin in Gannon City is quite comfortable, but I wouldn\'t be able to live there if I didn\'t work for Gannon City... What\'s more, young ones like me can claim all sorts of assistance! It\'s much better than wandering around, so I guess I\'ll just chill...

I work so hard every day too. I just slack off sometimes, um, no, I mean, I just sometimes get lost on my way! Coo Coo!I swear that I really do my work! A certain black fellow—Eho—thinks that I don\'t work just because she\'s a workaholic! Hmph! She even wanted me to work for free! So, I just ignored her. Coo Coo!

Hey, the truth is, I don\'t want to stay in the Illumina and don\'t want to do such dangerous work. I miss the days when I could slack off with my parents, but I didn\'t do sloppy work! The main reason is that you get to meet a lot of people when you deliver letters in Illumina, and I guess you get access to more information about the higher-ups when you become an information officer... Then I\'d surely be able to find out if my parents are still alive if I became one!However, I have been an information officer for three years now, and it seems like I\'m still just muddling along like before. It\'s not my choice to laze away, but nobody has told me what an information officer does. Although Vivian always told me that I am a messenger with potential and wanted me to take one step forward, I didn\'t really get what she meant, so I promised to join the exploration team...
