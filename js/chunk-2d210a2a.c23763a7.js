What exactly does she want from me?"},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"She\'s a nice companion. It\'s just that she\'s always talking about dedication and doctrines."},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"Seeming rather unapproachable."},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"Maybe this is an opportunity to get to understand her."},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"Anyway, no harm in going."},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"Um... Hi, is there something wrong with the Prism Pillar?"},{"char":"Angel:","dialogue":"Oh, it\'s fine. It\'s completely normal. Nothing\'s wrong."},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"(Really? Guess it\'s something else.)"},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"Ahem, so, Angel, what can I do for you?"},{"char":"Angel:","dialogue":"You\'re the owner of the Colossus, Navigator. Would you say this is the quietest place?"},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"I think so... There\'s nothing but a pillar here, and no one usually comes here..."},{"char":"Angel:","dialogue":"True. It is quiet here, but too bad it\'s..."},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"What is it?"},{"char":"Angel:","dialogue":"There\'s not enough sunlight here."},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"Hmm, a place that\'s both light and quiet... You should go to the lounge."},{"char":"Angel:","dialogue":"It is indeed very quiet there, but I think it makes people too quiet."},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"Too... quiet?"},{"char":"Angel:","dialogue":"As quiet as Dove."},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"Isn\'t that... being lazy? Ahem, forget about Dove."},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"I gather that you want to find a quiet spot where you can write or read on your own."},{"char":"Angel:","dialogue":"Yes."},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"Let me think... Well, there actually is a place for you!"},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"It\'s a very old room, but it\'s spotlessly clean and there seem to be some sort of desk-like protrusions in it..."},{"char":"Angel:","dialogue":"Just like the lounge?"},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"Yeah. Why don\'t we go have a look now?"},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"(Angel is probably just looking for a quiet lounge.)"},{"char":"Angel:","dialogue":"It is indeed just like how you described it."},{"char":"Angel:","dialogue":"Are those bookcases?"},{"char":"Angel:","dialogue":"Is this a desk?"},{"char":"Angel:","dialogue":"Its layout resembles that of a library."},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"There are a couple of desks over here. They seem to be places for people to sit and write, which is perfect for you."},{"char":"Angel:","dialogue":"So, can you do again what you did when you built the lounge last time? Perhaps ask the Colossus?"},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"I\'ll try sensing it..."},{"char":"Angel:","dialogue":"Wow... Even though I\'ve heard Vice talked about it, it\'s still amazing to see it with my own eyes."},{"char":"Angel:","dialogue":"Seems like this really is a library. What about that thing over there...?"},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"A coffee maker."},{"char":"Angel:","dialogue":"Hmm..."},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"(That\'s a rather subtle reaction...)"},{"char":"Angel:","dialogue":"This is a cafe, but also a place to rest."},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"(Angel seems to be acting weird... Isn\'t she looking for a lounge?)"},{"char":"Angel:","dialogue":"Hmm..."},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"Is there anything you\'d like to do, Angel? I can do my best to help."},{"char":"Angel:","dialogue":"Anything I\'d like to do?"},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"Yeah, I thought you were looking for a place to rest."},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"But that doesn\'t seem to be the case now."},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"You don\'t have to explain if you don\'t want to, though."},{"char":"Angel:","dialogue":"Oh, I get it, you\'re bothered by my behavior."},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"No, not exactly, just that you seem distracted."},{"char":"Angel:","dialogue":"Distracted? No, not at all, Navigator."},{"char":"Angel:","dialogue":"I\'m just looking for a place to pray."},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"Oh, that\'s why you needed somewhere quiet!"},{"char":"Angel:","dialogue":"If possible, I\'d prefer not to see objects like a coffee maker in a place of prayer."},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"(That is true.)"},{"char":"Angel:","dialogue":"But I\'m not going to demand much, seeing we\'re on this Colossus."},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"Thank you for understanding."},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"Speaking of which, are you going to pray right now?"},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"Would you like me to leave?"},{"char":"Angel:","dialogue":"No. I can sense you\'re curious about it."},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"Heh, nothing gets by you."},{"char":"Angel:","dialogue":"You can stay, but please keep quiet."},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"Of course. This is supposed to be a quiet place, anyway."},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"I\'ll just watch you pray."},{"char":"Angel:","dialogue":"Thank you, Navigator. It will only be a little while."},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"(Hey, that\'s probably the first time I see Angel being appreciative.)"},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"(Should I say... There\'s a sense of the sacred?)"},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"(Despite the partial wing, she appears more angelic than anyone right now.)"},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"(I\'m more and more intrigued about Lumopolis now...)"},{"char":"Angel:","dialogue":"Okay, I\'m done."},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"What? That fast?"},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"I thought it was going to be the, uh, time-consuming kind."},{"char":"Angel:","dialogue":"That would be the formal mass, attended by all of the disciples."},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"I see."},{"char":"Angel:","dialogue":"It doesn\'t take long when you\'re alone, when the occasion is informal."},{"char":"Angel:","dialogue":"At first I just wanted you to find me a quiet spot with plenty of sunlight, which doesn\'t cause drowsiness."},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"Then I thought maybe that place could also double as a place for prayers?"},{"char":"Angel:","dialogue":"Yes."},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"Got it. Feel free to use this place anytime you need it."},{"char":"Angel:","dialogue":"I shall come here when it\'s vacant."},{"char":"Angel:","dialogue":"So I will not bother anybody."},{"char":"Angel:","dialogue":"Of course, it\'s so I won\'t be bothered by anybody, too."},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"Sure, no problem."},{"char":"Angel:","dialogue":"Okay. If there\'s nothing else, I will take my leave."},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"Feel free to let me know if you need anything."},{"char":"Angel:","dialogue":"Don\'t overexert yourself, Navigator."},{"char":"Angel:","dialogue":"You\'ve already done enough for me today. Thank you."},{"char":"Angel:","dialogue":"I\'ll leave this library to others."},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"No problem."},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"(She left.)"},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"(Angel seems to give off an aura of holiness. I thought I was going to be more nervous than I was.)"},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"(It is great that she is personable and understanding.)"},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"(Hopefully, everyone will get along in the Colossus from now on.)"},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"It\'s awesome that the Colossus has a new facility, with more to come."},{"char":"Navigator:","dialogue":"Regardless, I should check back with the Bridge."}],"branch":[]}]}')}}]);
