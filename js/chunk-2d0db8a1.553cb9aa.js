After thinking about it, I decided to record my thoughts.It\'s a little magical and I haven\'t fully figured out what has happened yet. The Eclipsites invaded my hometown and destroyed everything. The only thing I had left was hatred and powerlessness from the death of my people. I couldn\'t reactive the Colossus for more than ten years, and I didn\'t know what had happened outside, so the feeling of emptiness wore down my will... until Vice came.Those unexpected circumstances taught me that I would still be powerless if I was all alone. Besides, neither the Colossus nor I am any good in a battle right now. Fortunately, Vice said she would stay on the Colossus to help me sort out my situation. She said I could ask her for help if I had any difficulties or if there was anything I didn\'t understand. Although I haven\'t known her for long, and might not know anything about her, I am truly thankful that she\'s here.—%s"},{"file_name":"Her Story (I)","files":"After I decided to help %s run the entire Colossus, %s showed me the record system of the Colossus. To be honest, I was a little embarrassed when I saw the record written above. I thought about it briefly and felt that this recording format could be further expanded. With %s\'s support, I wrote a similar Colossus Boarding Experience for all other members of the exploration team who boarded the Colossus and will do the same for every other new member who joins us on the Colossus. As for their own stories, it would probably be better to let them write that themselves or to get %s to record it.Ahem, let\'s get back to the point. After I boarded the Colossus and obtained %s\'s permission, I started exploring the Colossus and realized that the space inside is massive. It is almost the size of a small settlement. In short, I have always been interested in the creation, Colossus. I feel deeply fortunate that I have the chance to board it and help %s! I hope that the Illumina Federation approves my application. I believe that everything will be better if the Illumina supports our endeavors in this regard."},{"file_name":"Her Story (II)","files":"How awkward. Even though %s is a Caelestite who can control the Colossus, I must still note that %s is functionally a noncombatant and possesses normal intelligence... but with phenomenal sensory powers! When I first met %s in the ruins, I thought I had encountered an extraordinary entity.I know %s hates Eclipsites for killing his kin, and I worry for %s, because the road to vengeance is bloody and requires fighting prowess.While Illumina has expressed an intense interest in %s, I don\'t think approaching someone who has no outside contact for seventeen years with any ulterior motive is... a good idea, so I will offer my sincere help to %s, at least!"},{"file_name":"Her Story (III)","files":"Is it time for me to tell my own story? If I don\'t, this record will just be about %s.Actually, there\'s not much to tell. When I was young, I was selected as a reserve Colossus Navigator for some reason, and Illumina seemed to get real clingy about this development.My mom and pops, I don\'t have many memories of them. All I know is that I was born in Gannon City. My mother died giving birth to me, and I know nothing of my father at all. I sometimes try to imagine what my parents were like. I think that they must have been gentle and strong...There\'s no doubt that I am a better fighter than %s! Hey! since I was trained to be a Navigator, I might even help %s with the Colossus operation!"},{"file_name":"Her Story (IV)","files":"Did I tell you that I was once a reserve candidate Colossus Navigator? I was young at the time, but I thought I could handle it like an adult and was so confident in my talent...Now that I look back, I realize what a dumb kid I used to be. Although Ms. Gronru tried to persuade me not to force myself, kids are blind to the consequences of their failures, and so I thought it wouldn\'t hurt to just give it a try.As you\'d expect... Not only did the experiment fail, I almost hurt others as well, and caused Illumina to incur a major loss... I can\'t remember exactly what happened after that, but I couldn\'t stop thinking that if I had done things differently, perhaps it wouldn\'t have turned out like this.Anyway, there\'s no point in dwelling on the past. It\'s better to focus on what\'s in front of you! For example, do you think it\'s time to increase %s\'s training?"}],"story":[],"voice":["An excellent system with equal learning opportunities.
