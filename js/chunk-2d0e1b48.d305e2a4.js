Perhaps the fact that I awakened in this era is some kind of prediction?I\'m not interested in protecting anyone, but the game we\'re currently playing is quite fun! Why don\'t we clear this level?"}],"story":[],"voice":["Illumina is researchers\' paradise. We\'ll develop even more awesome stuffs. You\'ll see.","That Raphael Lumopolis sent is quite the researcher, but she\'s nowhere near my standard.","Splendor Illumina!","The extensive research into them is paused for the moment... I\'ll be more careful next time.","The current Grand Marshal is the best. Sometimes I even feel that she\'s more like a boss in a game.","Loser! That\'s quite a brag for someone so young. He\'s no match for me in terms of machine operation skills.","Things I like? Games, researches, old machineries, and the champion\'s throne.","I\'m sure the world would be a very unpleasant place without fun games!","Mechanical technology, biotechnology, Aurorian technology... Perhaps the Colossus is the perfect creation.","Have you finally made up your mind? Can I play with your Colossus?","As a researcher, you should look more from the outside in. It might give you a different perspective.","Is there such a rule? Damn...","That was fun! Let\'s go again, let\'s go again!","Megashock!","Mecha skill!","Let me have some fun!","Cleared for a year, here comes another year!","There\'s such a huge score difference between the first and second place!","The supreme power of the Age of Fear is awake!","No one can drag me out of this throne!","Regret opposing me now!","Steadfast cavalry, unfallible tactics, raw military might! We shall fight on the beaches... Tsk, back to my bad habits again. Need to remember what age I am!","Cleared! Phew!","Alchemy Stars!","The ruined of the testing ground remind me of how extraordinary the results of that bygone era were. I have indeed made a mistake, but failure is the mother of success, isn\'t it?","The tragedies of the world are none of my business, and I don\'t want to fake sympathy. Illumina is actually quite fun, isn\'t it?","My vehicle is a relic from a long time ago, something that could only have been built with a complete disregard for process and cost. I\'ve really hit the jackpot!","I\'m not bound by rules! I bet my life as a researcher that I will find the answer!","Do you want to count my victories? You see, no matter the game, my score always tops the leaderboard.","The Throne is a relic of a distant age, and only those who \\"first understood\\" the secrets it contains are entitled to use it.","My job is to clear the stages, and nothing else has anything to do with me, right? After all, everyone has their own stages to clear.","The giant crater in that realm is a spectacle indeed. I wish I had time to go and have a look, but it looks like the place has been taken over by a bunch of hobos.","We are all children abandoned by civilization... You really don\'t know anything about that era? Oh well, it\'s not surprising. After all, none of those things are recorded in the literatures open to the public.","The games here aren\'t that bad either, like operating the Colossus... What? It\'s not a game?","It is truly amazing that, with a clear mind, one can make the outside world feel both strange and new again.","A dungeon in the \\"World\\" has been updated. Wanna take on the challenge?","Look who\'s hereâ€”the loser!","No more talking and do the rock-paper-scissors! Ha, you lost!","So have you decided how you\'re gonna challenge me, loser?","Cheer up. To a researcher, the game has just begun!","You have an aura similar to mine. Have we met before? Or have you participated in the Emperor\'s Cup before? In that case, you must know me!","Let me guess. Is it a new game or an enhancement card?","Let me guess. You\'ve come up with some new gameplay?","I\'ve never seen anything so interesting at Illumina!","You know what I like to play!","Game start!","Wanna tap and try?","A new record is about to be made!","This power seemed to have failed to protect the era that created it, and now that I have rediscovered it, can it protect our era?","Perhaps one day this era will fall in the same way as those ancient empires, but these games will go on until the winner is determined.","My memory of the experiment is intact, but I don\'t want to share this useless knowledge with you. I can tell from your flabbergasted look that you are still at the inexperienced stage.","Game start! I\'m with Illumina!"],"skins":[],"description":"A female pilot of the giant mecha and the current Tech Officer of the Illumina Federation. She\'s said to be a genius retired from the military...
